<p>From these few passages we can see that it is not outward beauty or the wearing of jewelry, in and of itself, that the lord forbids. I feel like as long as people are coming to church to get the word and want to come to church and hear the word you should be grateful for that!!! A weave is.</p>

<p>A section for thieves, liars, murderers etc., and also a section for those who died with braided hair. So when you wear someone’s hair on your head, whatever they are afflicted by can be partially transferred to you. (1 ti 2:9) do not change the natural state of your hair in any way.

<p>Makes me feel they cooked up the law. 1 timothy 2:9 will condemn those who braid their hair. Wearing makeup ( like drinking alcohol) is a question of moderation rather than prohibition. It�s a well known fact that the early church fathers were against excessive women apparel, including makeup, earrings, dyeing of hair and so on. Thank you for watching!!!follow.</p>

<p>Scripture warns us that we must never focus on outer adornment at the cost of neglecting inner adornment. Trousers were made by god for men only! The only hair attachment allowed is thread made in nigeria, using any other thing to weave thy hair is a sin because it is makes you look prettier and thus commit a sin. Human.</p>

<p>1 timothy 2:9 will condemn those who braid their hair. If you change it (with hair dye, hair perm, or wear artificial hair), your name is removed from the book of life.

<p>We clearly see that god allows jewelry in ezekiel chapter 16, which is an allegory of god’s dealings with the nation of ancient israel. This does not mean that if a person is bald, then they don’t have a “glory” but in essence your glory sits on your head. No, with the same caution about not putting the wrong priority.</p>

<p>Wearing makeup and jewelry was perfectly acceptable during this time, so this scripture is not about wearing makeup, jewelry, wearing red, but how vain and useless to try and beautify ones self when the inside is filled with sin. A section for thieves, liars, murderers etc., and also a section for those who died with braided hair. It�s a well.</p>

<p>(braiding, plaiting, weaves, wigs and dreads, paintings, &amp; make ups are signs of rebellion and paganism practice’s) it kept bothering and praying for answer for many years why god forbid braiding natural hair for holiness people untill i read the scriptures and the lost. The rule against wearing different types of fabric was not a moral law. So, is it.</p>
