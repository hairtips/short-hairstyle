<p>When your hair is cut wet, it’s shorter than you wanted once it dries. I threw away all my round brushes and never looked back, and it’s been 15 years! I have very curly hair in the back of my head and wavy at the crown and front. I also find that the back/bottom of mine is curlier, maybe due.</p>

<p>Brushing your hair, using heavy products, or not using the right products can all flatten the top section of wavy hair. Scientists don’t know why different hair types develop, but the shape of the hair follicle matters (yours is wavy), as does. If i brush my hair, it�s similar to your front bits, if i leave it alone it�s a.</p>

<p>Have hair chemically relaxed in front to soften curls into loose waves. In around 2015, i bleached the top/front of my hair at home, twice on the same day, and i think i damaged the follicles, because that section has only gotten more and more curly as time goes on,it started at the temples and being frizzy. Be sure to.</p>

<p>Wavy &amp; straight hair on the same head! Dry hair absorbs moisture from the air, causing frizz, which also explains why humidity can make frizz even worse! Be sure to ask the stylist for something curly friendly. I also finally got a haircut and that’s helped a lot, i think my hair was getting weighed down and i got a.</p>

<p>Do you use heat on your hair? And after i’ve been to the salon and had app the good hydrating products and then the next day i take a shower boom my hair is wavy from root to tip. If you use/used heat or got a relaxer/perm, then there could be a possibility that it is damaged. Oval tubes are.</p>

<p>Your waves in the back look nice but if you want them to be curly like the front of your head, you need your hair to lay differently than how it is currently layered. I notice in the front of my hair some ringlets are starting to form. If the underside of your hair is curlier than the top layer.</p>

<p>If your hair is chemically relaxed or treated with a keratin treatment, you can utilize products to encourage soft waves in the front of your hair to blend with soft waves in back. It might be from the water hitting the back of my head harder in the shower or because of the weight of my hair. What really helps.</p>

<p>For an example, see this post. Scientists don’t know why different hair types develop, but the shape of the hair follicle matters (yours is wavy), as does. Cut layers into your hair (find a curly hair specialist) so that the back pieces are shorter and the curls can revive themselves. If i brush my hair, it�s similar to your front.</p>

<p>What really helps my waves (i�m a wavy canopy and curlier underneath gal) is to use a curl enhancer like fsg+ aloe or protein (or both) under a harder hold gel, to scrunch a lot and try to make sure that clumps of hair hold together so the wavier or curlier hairs in each clump can help the less wavy.</p>
