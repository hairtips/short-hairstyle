And at the time my crown area was thinning out like a circle of some sort, but as of today 5/16/12 by hair in the crown section has filled in so much it’s unbelieveable how full my hair has gotton.

<p>I also know that this could just be temporary thinning, but i�m not sure. I was the type to rarely wear my natural hair, i loved a good wig install! These problems affect numerous women as well. Therefore, it is crucial to meet with your doctor to get to the root of what is causing hair thinning. My older family.</p>

<p>One of the most common reasons that cause hair thinning at crown among males is iron deficiency anemia. Hair loss during aging is totally normal, but there is plenty you can do to tackle it. Perhaps accompanied by a receding hairline. My hair is getting long and has grown back but there are no curls on the crown but there.</p>

<p>My final hair transplant journey (over 9k total fue grafts). If it is then very minimal. It was depressing especially after slowly getting over the picked hen look.

<p>My crown is thinning *** not my actually scalp, but my hair in general. My hair is still short and there always was a parting point right next to my crown swirl.

<p>Follow our social media instagram @thehairtransplantnetwork facebook, pintrest, linkedin. This typically impacts one side of the scalp more than the other and in many cases, the hair will regrow on its own.
