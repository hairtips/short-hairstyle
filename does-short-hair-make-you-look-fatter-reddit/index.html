<p>Does cutting your short hair make your face look fat? Like a bulky sweater, a puffy down coat not only makes women look fatter, but it also makes them look shapeless. I saw pictures of celebs with short hair and it looked amazing, so i went with a lob. This is even suitable with all that you love to hair.</p>
<h3 id="well-it-depends-on-how-you-style-your-hair">Well, it depends on how you style your hair.</h3><p>“if the bob is cut short in the back and longer in the front, it. Actually, it is affected by factors like your face shape, your hairdos. A lot of men with more delicate features, or men who are shorter/thinner don’t want long hair for the same reason, they don’t want to look feminine. Just make sure you are prepared to flaunt it till it grows longer. However, you hair type, volume and length will also determine the right hairdo for you. I�m not trying to be offensive.</p>
