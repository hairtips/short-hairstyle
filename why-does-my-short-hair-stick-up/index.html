<p>#hairtips #hairstylist #thesalonguy in this video i share why your hair sticks up. When it’s short, it tends to stick straight out. If you let it grow out, though, viel says it will have enough weight to lie flat and blend in with the rest of your hair. These are your baby hairs, and while they can sometimes be caused by broken hairs, they�re more commonly either new hair growth or fine hairs that occur naturally at the start of your hairline.</p>
<h3 id="once-your-hair-is-completely-dry-use-a-heat-protectant-spray">Once your hair is completely dry, use a heat protectant spray.</h3><p>Don�t pluck gray hairs as they come in. I used to use gel and stuff, but i really don�t like that because it either makes my hair all hard, or. They are just the right length to not lay down. I�ve had tiny hairs that stick up in the middle of my center part for years. When you�re styling your hair, you might sometimes notice fine little hairs sticking up around your hairline. I disagree with anyone who says that shorter hair is less maintenance, it really depends on how your hair is and your face shape blahblahblah.</p>
