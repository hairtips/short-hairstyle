<p>More hair loss on one side is common. She had to trim it to make it even. I�ve noticed that no matter what i do, my face framing and curls on the side of my head are much curlier than the curls on the back of my head. Everyday life exposes our hair to stressors that can cause breakage and.</p>

<p>We do quite frequently see patients who have significantly more hair loss on one side of the head than the other as part of their progression with androgenetic alopecia. One side of a beard can be curlier than the other due to the shape of the follicles on that side. I guess i feel this is one thing many curlies.</p>

<p>I guess i feel this is one thing many curlies need to just accept. I�m not sure if she is right, but i am glad i am not the only one with the problem! At first i thought bleaching killed my curl but now that i�ve gotten rid of most of the bleached bits, it. One side of a beard.</p>

<p>Studies may indicate a faster growth in back of head versus front. Growing up that side was always more receded looking but it’s gotten ridiculous lately. I�m not sure if she is right, but i am glad i am not the only one with the problem! That still only does so much. I also have cowlicks in the front that.</p>

<p>One side of my hair is curlier than the other if you find that one side of your head (or the back) is straighter than the rest, this can be from friction damage while sleeping. Something to do with it being easier to do the non dominant side of your head. I�m not sure if she is right, but i.</p>

<p>It is kinda weird that a whole side is different from the other. One side of a beard can be curlier than the other due to the shape of the follicles on that side.

<p>I know how it feels. Something to do with it being easier to do the non dominant side of your head. Send thanks to the doctor.

<p>Usually i will stop and kind of wiggle my fingers up near my scalp and shake my head to break up the curls. Therefore it is very likely to have an infection on one side and not the other. Everyday life exposes our hair to stressors that can cause breakage and thinning. Usually you hear about people having different textures.</p>

<p>All humans have a �stronger� side to their hair than the other. Yes, it’s indeed possible the hair on one side of the head can appear to grow faster than on the other side. Various studies have shown that hair at the back of the head may tend to have a faster growth rate in some cases than the front.</p>

<p>It is not known what causes it, but it is thought to be genetic. I have an overbite on the left side and an underbite on the right side. As you can see in the pictures one side of my face is clearly larger than the other. One side colder than other [ follow ups ] [ post followup ].</p>

<p>Also, my jaw clicks when i open my mouth wide. My sister relaxed her shoulder length hair, and only then did we notice that one side was quite noticeably longer than the other. For example, if you always sleep on your right side, you may find that the hair on the right side of your head is more damaged, and.</p>

<p>Various studies have shown that hair at the back of the head may tend to have a faster growth rate in some cases than the front of the head. All humans have a �stronger� side to their hair than the other. I also occasionally use an olive oil based product to combat dryness since my hair has very little natural.</p>

<p>At my deva cut, the stylist said to scrunch the wavy side and rake the curlier side. One side of my hair is curlier than the other if you find that one side of your head (or the back) is straighter than the rest, this can be from friction damage while sleeping. The plus side is that like the poster.</p>

<p>That still only does so much. Ok, now that you’re aware that mother nature (and sometimes even genetics) is a significant part of the reason why one side of your hair may be thinner than the other, let’s look at some other things that you might be doing that could possibly be making matters “worse”. I know how it feels..</p>

<p>Lately, one side of my hair has been a lot flatter the other. I have an overbite on the left side and an underbite on the right side. I know how it feels. It is kinda weird that a whole side is different from the other. We do quite frequently see patients who have significantly more hair loss on one.</p>

<p>The most common explanation that one side of your hair may be thinner than the other is because of where you part your hair. Videos you watch may be added to the tv�s watch history and influence. The curls on one side of my head never seem to match the curls on the other. It is not known what causes.</p>

<p>Send thanks to the doctor. Something to do with it being easier to do the non dominant side of your head. I use tresemme naturals shampoo and conditioner and either mousse or a curl creme. The curls on one side of my head never seem to match the curls on the other. At my deva cut, the stylist said to.</p>

<p>My left cheek looks swollen and my jaw is not alligned. One side of my hair is curlier than the other if you find that one side of your head (or the back) is straighter than the rest, this can be from friction damage while sleeping. Ok i just went in to get my hair colored darker again and the.</p>
