<h3 id="im-not-a-fan-of-this-because-i-always-tend-to-spray-too-much-product">I’m not a fan of this because i always tend to spray too much product.</h3><p>Most women overcondition their hair, and the hair is too slippery to hold a curl,  says abergel.

Once it becomes a bit tacky (it usually takes about a minute), put it in your hair.</p>
