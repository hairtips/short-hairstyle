Even with the proper care and maintenance, there are some external factors that can play into how your hair’s growth, curl pattern and texture change. Many people associate aging with the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on the face, but your hair can show your age, too. Of course, significant textural changes will depend on things that have happened in life, such as whether you’ve had children, suffered from conditions like alopecia or gone through treatments like chemotherapy.</p>
<h3 id="your-hair-like-everything-else-on-your-body-can-change-over-time-for-many-different-reasons">Your hair, like everything else on your body, can change over time for many different reasons.</h3><p>Turning gray is just one of the many changes your hair goes through as you age.
