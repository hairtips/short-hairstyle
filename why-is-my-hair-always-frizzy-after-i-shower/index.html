<p>Only cones calmed my frizz, but they make my hair brittle, so i just live with frizzier hair the first day and try to moisturize as much as possible. When your hair loses its natural oils, or sebum, any hot or humid temperatures are going to dry your hair out. Hair is at its weakest when it’s wet. That’s why.</p>

Hot water strips your scalp and hair of the natural oils that keep your hair moisturised and shiny. This is exactly what�s always happened to me! When your hair is cut wet, it’s shorter than you.</p>

<p>When wet, your hair becomes heavy and/or stretched. So cowashing and not stripping my hair with sulfate shampoo has helped me a lot with frizzy and puffy hair. I have to wash my hair at night, to let my hair calm down before i go outside the next day. Hot water strips your scalp and hair of the natural oils.</p>
