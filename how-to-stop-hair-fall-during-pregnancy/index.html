Most Common Tips To Avoid Hair Loss During Pregnancy From hairsure.in</p>
<p>The american pregnancy association recommends the following: For many women, everything tends to work in favor of hair health during their pregnancy. Avoid brushing your hair while it is wet. You should keep a check on your hair growth between 6 to 12 months after delivery.</p>
<h3 id="this-is-the-reason-why-every-cancer-patient-will-have-hair-fall-during-their-treatment">This is the reason why every cancer patient will have hair fall during their treatment.</h3><p>To keep your hair as healthy as possible, avoid any type of chemical treatments that damage the hair or scalp in form. Soak fenugreek seeds overnight and apply the strained water directly on the scalp. This kind of hair loss is called postpartum telogen effluvium. As we read above, the overproduction of hormones occurring will prevent this from happening. Aloe vera and avocados (mashed and mixed with an egg and half of teaspoon of olive oil) can provide respite for hair breakage and help restore hair to a healthy condition. During pregnancy, develop a hair care regime to massage your scalp at least three days a week.</p>
