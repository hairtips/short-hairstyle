<p>Unsure of what else to recommend other then maybe a little bit of wax to just stop it from frizzing? A horizontal one across the head, and two at the back, with a center parting.

<p>Pull your tot’s hair back from her face with clips or a headband so it doesn’t bother her. This is a hairstyle for toddlers having wavy or fine hair with some texture.

<p>Bring the end of the twisted ponytail to the bottom and slowly wrap the ponytail forming a bun.
