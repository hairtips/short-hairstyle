It’s never a bad idea to give your freshly minted curl a little extra twist or a quick finger curl right after it clears the flat iron to encourage staying power. The thermasmooth smooth guard serum by mizani is the perfect option for anyone with curly hair.</p>

In simple terms, the dripping water forms bubbles when heated from the inside of your hair, and the steam trying to escape can cause terrible damage to your hair. Use a heat protectant to seal the cuticle and form a protective barrier around each strand, says powell. What about heat protectant sprays? Babyliss pro nano titanium straightening iron is one of the best flat irons for delicate hair because of its dependable performance and virtually effortless styling.</p>
