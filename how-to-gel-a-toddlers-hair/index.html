<p>Place the shampoo in their hands and let them have a go. Kindly use a smooth and soft hair brush for combing your toddler’s hair. “toddlerhood is definitely the most difficult age for cutting hair,” says hilary trant, a hairstylist with the markham, ont., branch of melonhead children’s hair care, a chain of salons geared to children. Run a brush or comb through the gelled hair at the top to get a neat, flat look.</p>
<h3 id="can-toddlers-wear-hair-gel">Can toddlers wear hair gel.</h3><p>Mix together all the ingredients and apply to your child’s clean hair.

The right brush for the right hair is very essential. I wore mine up in a claw clip, french twist style (so no ponytail to yank), and would often add extra protection to the front of my head with a wide fabric headband.
