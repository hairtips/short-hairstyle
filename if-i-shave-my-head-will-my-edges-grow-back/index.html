<p>Shaving abruptly and bluntly cuts off hair at the skin of the scalp or in close proximity to the scalp. Arrojo adds that regardless of how you cut hair, it typically grows at the same rate—even if it doesn�t seem like it—which is usually a mere six inches per year (or a little more than one centimeter per month). You will probably be fine, though. The belief that shaving your head will cause your hair to grow back stronger is just not true.</p>
<h3 id="while-the-resulting-stubble-might-seem-thicker-it039s-not">While the resulting stubble might seem thicker, it�s not.</h3><p>Instead, shaving only gives the appearance of thicker hair. It seems thicker because it�s all brisly when it grows back. Your hair will grow — fast. Men�s haircuts tend to have a short back and sides, so the tennis ball look will be weird, and you�ll have to wear it until your hair is long enough for a haircut, or shave it again. So when you shaved it, it looked like it suddenly became curly because of the haircut. Although the style appears clean cut and neat initially, it becomes frizzy and unstylish within a few weeks.</p>

<p>In 1928, a medical report entitled hair growth and shaving from mildred trotter began to debunk this theory.
