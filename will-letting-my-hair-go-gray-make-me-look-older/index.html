These 50 Women Refuse To Dye Their Hair And Look Amazing From demilked.com</p>
<p>Many women tell me that they don’t want their gray to shine through because they are afraid it will make them look old. Whether you have a full crown of gray hair or are just starting to see some signs of it, you have the power to. I found myself happy with my age and no longer wondering if i look old or not. Very often women who do this create a single block of color, with very little contrast (especially if it�s too dark or too light) and this can drain your face, making you look tired and possibly older.</p>
<h3 id="i-feel-with-gray-hair-i-need-to-have-my-hair-styled--blown-out-or-ironed--and-makeup-on">I feel with gray hair i need to have my hair styled — blown out or ironed — and makeup on;</h3><p>Letting hair go completely grey is certainly easier in one respect (not having to dye it) but it does bring some other hair issues to the table. Check out 10 ways to go gray with grace and choose one or several to map out your own journey. Back in the day, gray hair used to be associated with wisdom and knowledge. With the correct haircut and style, you can honor the movement of your face and your overall energy in a simple way that prevents your gray hair from making you look older than you’d like. Women who use very dark dye (like i did) are often surprised to find that the dark dyed hair actually made them look older than their age because of the harsh contrast between their hair and their complexion. Letting hair go completely grey is certainly easier in one respect (not having to dye it) but it does bring some other hair issues to the table.</p>
