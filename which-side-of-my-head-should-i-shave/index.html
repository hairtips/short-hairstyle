<p>I am scheduled for left temporal lobe surgery in about 2 months and was wondering if it would be better to just shave my head and let it start scratch from the beginning, or just let them shave where the incision is going to be. If you have thick hair, it still looks like a pretty full head of hair.</p>

<p>When you finish the sides, shave the top of your head, working from your forehead to the back of your head. By the next day, your head will start to feel like sandpaper.

<p>To pull out any radical haircut you must be confident and calm, and dont care a lot about bad opinions.

<p>If shaving with the grain causes you to miss some hairs, you should try shaving side to side. Overweight or bodybuilder types usually look better with shaved heads or shaved hairstyles. You may agree that shaving it all down would look better than buzzing just the sides and back. I am scheduled for left temporal lobe surgery in about 2.</p>

<p>The part in the back has to be fudged to keep the buns of near equal size. I kept my head buzzed for years, alternating it between a cute bob, then shaving the back of my head into what’s known as a chelsea. This creates a beautiful, stately look that will compliment any outfit. This is what i did. You.</p>

<p>Secondly, use your baldness as a valid reason to start working out and get in crazy good shape. If you miss some hairs on the back of your head by shaving with the grain, try shaving from side to side. A bald man that’s in shape always looks better, no matter what. Everything you need to know before going for.</p>

<p>If you have thick hair, it still looks like a pretty full head of hair when left down. A bald man that’s in shape always looks better, no matter what.
