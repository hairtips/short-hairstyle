As it is not always possible to assess the cause of rapid or excessive hair loss, it is always worth seeking medical advice to diagnose the cause of your hair loss. If you suspect that a treatment or drug is causing your hair loss, talk with your doctor. The amount of hair on your body will be different from other people.</p>
<h3 id="possible-causes-of-hair-loss-include-androgenetic-alopecia-pregnancy-and-telogen-effluvium">Possible causes of hair loss include androgenetic alopecia, pregnancy, and telogen effluvium.</h3><p>Once the hair falls out, it will not come back. This may result in thinning of the hair and may even delay the growth of new hair strands. The anagen phase continues for a period depending on the type of body hair, then slows down for the resting, or telogen, phase. Hair becomes less dense and the scalp may become visible. As a person ages, their body begins to produce fewer androgens. In men, testosterone is the hormone responsible for hair growth on the face and body.</p>
