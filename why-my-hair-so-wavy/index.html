<p>Answer #1 the straightener not being hot enough isnï¿½t the problem like the people about wrote. If you have more in common.

Chances are your hair isnï¿½t straight and frizzy, you may be naturally wavy. The longer the hair, the more pronounced the wave, so if control is your aim, keep your wavy hairstyles for men under three inches or so in length. The rest of my hair is wavy. And i shall live in the palace at alexandria when i have killed my brother, who drove me out of it. And just as hormones may impact hair texture, any medications that affect hormones, such as glucocorticoids or thyroxine, could also potentially make hair become wavy or curly.</p>
