Also, if the hair is extremely straight or coarse, it may not wind properly, resulting in a straight rather than curly look.</p>
<h3 id="the-permed-hair-tends-to-be-more-porous-due-to-the-lifting-of-the-cuticle-layer-by-the-perming-chemicals">The permed hair tends to be more porous due to the lifting of the cuticle layer by the perming chemicals.</h3><p>Once the hair is curled, you can roll it up and clip it so it cools in the curled form.
