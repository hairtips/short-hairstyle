<p>Wavy hair is its own type, whether you have fine strands or thick locks. Be realistic when choosing the correct styling tools for your thick hair. Having looked through them, you’ll realize that your hair structure is not a curse but a cool. Should i comb my wavy, thick hair?</p>
<h3 id="when-it-comes-to-choosing-products-for-your-thick-hair-opt-for-natural-ingredients-over-artificial">When it comes to choosing products for your thick hair, opt for natural ingredients over artificial.</h3><p>Whether you have thick naturally wavy hair or fine strands, frizz can be an issue for people with curled, wavy, or textured hair. However, the cardinal rule of heat styling your hair is to use a heat protectant spray before it. These side bangs will frame your face and lighten the load on the back of your head. After shampooing, apply a conditioner to the tips to moisturize the ends without weighing down the roots. Cut a thick fringe of side bangs into your thick wavy style to lessen the load on the back of your hair. Hair care products such as shampoos and conditioners packed full of harsh chemicals and manmade ingredients can strip the hair of moisture and natural oils, often causing thick hair to become really dry and brittle.</p>
