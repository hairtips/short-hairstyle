<h3 id="according-to-the-article-changes-in-facial-shape-can-make-us-look-older">According to the article, changes in facial shape can make us look older.</h3><p>I’d much rather look like the dried raisin guy that jogs a 5k than a plump, red faced guy who sweats while brushing his teeth. If you’re only planning on losing a few pounds, you will not actually get taller. A thin face is the lead culprit because being slender causes a loss of volume in the face, guyuron says. Or, you’ve lost 20 pounds because you wanted to be more fit, but your eyes and cheeks are looking more sunken. The fact of the matter, weight loss can make your face look more aged for several reasons. The reason is that the face naturally loses fat as we get older.</p>
