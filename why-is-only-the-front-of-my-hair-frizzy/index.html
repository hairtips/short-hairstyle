<p>It’s a little bit wavier than yours but the back is straighter than the front. As a consequence, your hair starts being frizzy and dry instead of being defined and smooth. Why is my hair so frizzy? This causes hair to seek moisture from the air around it, which is why humidity often makes matters worse. Cutting long, soft layers.</p>

<p>This happens more than you would think. Try to let your hair dry with natural air instead of using a blow dryer. Frizzy hair, also called frizz, happens when the cuticle layer of each strand of your hair opens up, allowing the moisture from the air to pass through and swell all the strands. It is always dry (and my.</p>

<p>A lot can contribute to this though, including hormones. Also, why is only the top layer of my hair frizzy? Usually the back stays frizzy. Hair and scalp become dry, and hair lacks shine. I don�t believe there is a way to fix it.</p>

<p>Apply this rule of thumb: Why is the top layer of my hair straight? After washing my hair, they again blow dried and straightened it pin straight with a flat iron. Hair in the top layer is more likely to be frizzy because it is the most exposed hair part to pollution, sunlight, humidity, and friction when we sleep. It’s.</p>

<p>After washing my hair, they again blow dried and straightened it pin straight with a flat iron. Shampooing every two to three days is normally sufficient. It’s not uncommon to see hair that is relatively straight on top but with strong kinks underneath, or maybe an erratic and frizzy surface hiding much smoother hair underneath. Is my hair mixed texture?.</p>
