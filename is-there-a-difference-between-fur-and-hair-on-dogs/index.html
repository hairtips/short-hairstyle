The Difference Between Dog Fur and Dog Hair From msn.com</p>
<p>This reduces shedding and dander, an irritant for many people with allergies. Additionally, fur is often shed. The term �cat hair� is commonly used for pets that have sparse or thin hair covering the entire body. There are over three dozen dog breeds that grow hair instead of fur.</p>

Asian people’s hair has greater elasticity and grows faster than other races. On mammals, fur is designed to be an insulator. Hair and fur are the same thing.

<p>Because longer hair tends to trap allergens, many of these dogs are considered hypoallergenic,. Both hair growth and fur growth pass through several distinct phases as part of their growth cycle, and how long each phase takes is one of the core elements in telling hair from fur.
