Brushing it, using regular shampoo &amp; conditioner, and not treating the curls, then it�s quite easy.</p>

<p>Brushing it, using regular shampoo &amp; conditioner, and not treating the curls, then it�s quite easy to think that your hair is not curly. Also most wavy hair is straight till the ears down, so we don�t often get any root lift sadly. I have always had a high hair line and i have noticed on the website a lot.</p>

<p>Apply gel to your roots and lengths. Here�s how it happened for me: Many salons i have been to lack. With waves being fragile, just combing them can crush the wave pattern and make it dry straight. Its pattern ranges from loose loops to ‘s’ shaped waves.</p>

<p>Flat irons are damaging as is, but on wet hair they are much worse. according to michelle of the beauty blog lab muffin, using a flat iron on wet hair causes the water in your hair to literally pop , which explains the sizzling noises your hair makes. Coily hair is much drier than straight, wavy and curly hair. However,.</p>

<p>I did this, and i saw more waves and more defined waves in my hair than before, but the difference was fairly subtle. I am 24 years old and over the past year i have seen a huge change in my hair. Some hair products contain harsh ingredients such as sulfates and drying alcohols. When the hair dries out from.</p>

<p>The ingredients in your hair products are drying. Are you drying your hair down? Also, no combing the waves! So how that tube is shaped determines if the hair sprouting from it is curly or straight. I don�t know if will help at all, because it will depend on your hair type(fine, coarse etc) but i have personally found that.</p>

<p>Wavy hair tends to be straight when wet and. Basically, as the hair grows up and out of it, it acts as a bit of a tube. When i comb my hair to put in my bun/ponytail, it combs out straight.i think this has to do with elasticity. If you are just trying this the first time, you do not.</p>
