Many people who opt for the big chop for this reason feel as though cutting off their hair helps to restart the hair growth process.</p>
<h3 id="if-this-sounds-too-good-to-be-true-thats-because-it-is">If this sounds too good to be true, that’s because it is.</h3><p>In my case, thankfully, before i big chop i purchased a few hair essentials for dry 4c tightly coiled natural hair, hoping these hair care essentials would help me get. Oils such as coconut and jojoba not only seal in moisture but when massaged. First you’ll need to choose products that work for your natural hair. The best products after the big chop will depend on your hair texture and condition. Doing things outside of your comfort zone is the core of going natural.
