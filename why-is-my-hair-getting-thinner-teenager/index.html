It’s normal to shed around 100 hairs every day, but as you get older, this speeds up, making the hair look thinner, especially at the crown.

<p>Certain medical conditions may also lead to thinning hair. Potential causes of hair loss in teenagers include genetic factors, hormonal imbalances, and underlying medical conditions.
