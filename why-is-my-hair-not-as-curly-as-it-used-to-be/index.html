<p>However, using zero heat to dry my hair means my hair is wet for hours; If your cuticles are open, hair absorbs moisture more. First, squirt a dab of your favorite curl cream (or gel) into the palm of your hand. My hair my whole life could hardly hold a curl. After giving birth to my first, i noticed some.</p>

<p>Few people their hair actually changes shape and texture on its own and its not just because of the weather.scientists dont know how this happens but they think it has to do with genetics hormones and body chemistry.many peoples hair can go from curly to straight but it could also be due to heat damage so therefore you need to.</p>

<p>Mix the two products and take a look. Everyone has to trim their hair no matter if it is curly or straight. After giving birth to my first, i noticed some waves on the back of my head. Just like adding too little product during the hair curling process, adding too much can be a reason why your hair won’t.</p>

<p>My hair dryer has a cold, warm and hot setting. Rinse with a mild shampoo after 30 minutes. Science is a long way off from fully understanding what exactly causes hair to be curly and what factors can turn hair from straight to curly with age. Just like adding too little product during the hair curling process, adding too much.</p>

<p>Next, grab the second product and squirt an equal amount of the (gel or cream) into the palm of your hand. When this happens, you lose that “spring” in the hair because your curl pattern goes astray. Once it�s totally dry, use your fingers to dress the curl out, but be gentle! There are just so many things that affect.</p>

<p>While how often you wash your hair is entirely up to you and typically dependent upon on a number of factors—scalp moisture, sebum production, workout schedule among them—it’s recommended that curly hair types keep the shampooing to a minimum. Oh my pubic hairs ain’t curly any more! Mix the two products and take a look. Or if it happened after.</p>

<p>However, it can also happen with natural changes due to age. Styling has been so frustrating. Why won’t my hair wave or curl anymore?
