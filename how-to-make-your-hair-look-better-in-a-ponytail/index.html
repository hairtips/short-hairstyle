<p>Whether you are seeking an item to cover your thin hair or wanting to update your look with a new hairstyle, the ponytail extension for short hair is definitely a wise choice to consider. Place them at a steep, diagonal angle, and they’ll lift your ponytail for a heightened look.

Select a wide section of hair on top of your head and gather it towards the back to form the ponytail.</p>
