<p>I know there is supposed to be a healthy amount of hair shed following removal of braids. That has been my experience too. I myself have been guilty of this when opting for a braid or twist option because it’s so simple to throw my braids into a bun and go. Take a strand of hair out of the shed.</p>

<p>If little pieces of hair land on your shirt when you comb or manipulate it, it could mean your hair is breaking. Why do i have breakage? Combine that with wearing a style for a whole month. Spoiling your hair with some down time after protective styling can give your scalp down. That has been my experience too.</p>

<p>This is what will happen if you misuse pure protein for hair. If you can’t see the bulb, feel for it on the end of the hair strand. If it has a transparent bulb at the end, then this is shedding. It should be the length of your hair but if the majority of the shed hair is all broken.</p>

<p>If you can’t feel a slight bump, then it’s breakage. Protein plays a significant role as it strengthens and fortifies your follicles and your tresses! That has been my experience too. Hence, shed hair is the majority of what you will see when you take down the style. Too much moisture can lead to weak hair follicles;</p>

<p>But unfortunately, braiding hair does not speed up growth rate. When our hair is braided, though it is not being manipulated frequently, it is still under stress by the weight, friction, and synthetic nature of the extensions.
