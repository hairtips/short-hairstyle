In today�s video, i am going to be answering a question i get pretty often which is how do i change my hair type. And that makes sense—after all, i�d never even thought of my porosity levels before i started.</p>

<p>Type 4c is the densest of all type 4 hair categories. And this is where the art of negotiation comes into play. Your best bet is to experiment with products until you find one that makes your hair softer and more manageable which changes hair texture without using chemicals. As hair grows, the weight will naturally stretch the curls, but.</p>

<p>Can you change your hair type? Your coils have a noticeable and tight curl pattern. Although wash and go’s are a good option for this hair type, it will still need a bit more attention to maintain a visible curl pattern. The hair strands of a type 4a natural will closely resemble the letter s and are densely packed together.</p>

<p>Avoid brushing your hair harshly. Can you change your hair type? I wanted to give some really imp. I have a mixture of 3c and 4a hair (the front is 3c and the middle is 3c/4a and the back back is 4a) if there isn. The cuticle is responsible for retaining hydration and protecting your hair from damage), meaning your.</p>

<p>As hair grows, the weight will naturally stretch the curls, but 4c will never have the same texture as 4a type. The 3c, 4a, and 4c hair types apply to curly or kinky hair in particular. Moreover, like type 4c hair, it does not have a clearly defined curl pattern. Learn how coconut oil can help keep your coily hair.</p>

<p>Again, like type 4b hair, the texture may range from super fine and thin to wiry and coarse. Heat will loosen whatever curl pattern you have. The short answer is maybe. This is the dense hair type where the hair is coiled into a s shape. What is type 4a hair?</p>

<p>Seeing my hair next to gerilyn�s hair made it a lot more obvious. Hair regimens have been developed for various hair types. You can also add some changes and with the help of a clipper after tying your hair in this way cut some of them, from the sides. Your best bet is to experiment with products until you find.</p>

<p>While this may not work the same way for everyone with the same hair type, it is a more specific guide than most. It has an “s” pattern when stretched, much like type 3 curly hair.
