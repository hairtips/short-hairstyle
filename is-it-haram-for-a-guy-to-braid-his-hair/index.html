<p>As for something like braiding or plaiting his hair, i�m sure you would agree that these are things women usually do. What is meant by tying the hair is to fasten the braid of hair around the head, as women do, or to gather the hair and tie it at the back of the head. While this is no clear indication that locking ones hair is islamically permissible it is a clear indication that men did often in that time braid their hair and kept their hair rather long shoulder length or a bit past the shoulders. This would be different than a method to make oneself more attractive, this is being done in order to give members of islam distinction between other religions.</p>
<h3 id="for-a-man-ought-not-to-cover-his-head-since-he-is-the-image-and-glory-of-god-but-woman-is-the-glory-of-man">For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of god, but woman is the glory of man.</h3><p>There is no shar�i problem with a man growing his hair, as long as it is socially accepted within the �urf of the islamic community that he lives in and as long as he does not bring criticism to himself from other muslims. It shows that we don�t have to go to the lengthy discussion of whether or not the fact that it is a custom of the rastafarians makes it haraam or not, but rather the fact that a man is not allowed to pray with his hair braided back prevents us from having dread locks, since dreadlocks can not be taken down for the prayer. This is ideal for guys that have long hair on the top, maybe you’ve already styled a man bun in the past and want to try something new. Man braids halal but what about man buns? There is thick warrior braid of long hair, roughly put together.the sides of the head go through shaving to put more focus on the viking braid and you can even go for a fade if you do not want to shave off the sides of your head.
