<p>Other people don’t notice my sides but if you look close enough you’d be able to see the bald spot on the right side, so i always wear my hair down in a curtain. Surgical hair thinning treatments are successful, but costly. Why does hair stick out on the sides? It can be freaky for your boxer or bulldog or schnauzer to suddenly have two symmetrical bald spots that appear.</p>
<h3 id="however-it-is-good-that-you-have-had-those-things-checked-recently">However, it is good that you have had those things checked recently.</h3><p>Finasteride may help you hold to them longer by lowering your dht. It can occur in discrete patches, or more diffusely over larger areas of the head. When brushing or washing your hair, or even after light pulling, a few strands of hair may fall out.

The front edges on the top and sides are usually very sensitive to dht and the first to start showing recession and thinning.</p>
