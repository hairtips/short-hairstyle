A tukey test was applied to this data showing that all three hair colors differed significantly from each other. Iâm mostly referring to the really light or golden blonde.</p>

<p>Let us know on the ellen k morning show. 28.6% said they prefer black hair.

<p>Iï¿½ll chose black haired brunettes as my second place, following brownish red, redheads, dark blond and my least favorite bleach blond (that almost white color).

<p>One study says that women are attracted to men in red because of their status. Brunettes were likely favored for their steadiness and earning potential. Red hair was deemed least attractive by both groups, however. Women rated the female models with brown hair as most attractive, followed by women with blond hair.
