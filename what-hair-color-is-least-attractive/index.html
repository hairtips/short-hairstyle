<p>In the study entitled �british men�s hair color preferences: When it came to women with other hair colors (yeah, hello!) 29.5% of men preferred blondes and 8.8% of men preferred redheads. A tukey test was applied to this data showing that all three hair colors differed significantly from each other. I’m mostly referring to the really light or golden blonde.</p>

<p>Let us know on the ellen k morning show. 28.6% said they prefer black hair. A guy might have the wrong hair color (or even be bald) and if he is confident, charismatic, has a masculine vibe and has an interesting and engaging conversation style, a woman is unlikely to say, “well he really is perfect in every other way..</p>

<p>Brunette was clearly the hair color perceived as most attractive, with blonde as the second most attractive, and red as the least attractive. What hair color do guys find most attractive?

<p>I�ll chose black haired brunettes as my second place, following brownish red, redheads, dark blond and my least favorite bleach blond (that almost white color).

<p>One study says that women are attracted to men in red because of their status. Brunettes were likely favored for their steadiness and earning potential. Red hair was deemed least attractive by both groups, however. Women rated the female models with brown hair as most attractive, followed by women with blond hair. Red hair was the least common hair color.</p>
