<p>When it�s straightened and them curled it looks ok. Don�t be so self concious. It just looks more exotic, straight hair seems plain to me a lot of the time.

<p>It�s utterly depressing too because i went from perfect curls (if i took care of them, soft ringlets) to wavyish poof. Also, it�s because if a person with straight hair does nothing but wash and brush it, it can still look decent. First of all, it ruins your hair and makes it frizzier.

<p>Secondly, it doesn’t look good. I think this is the only hairstyle for girls with curly hair that looks cuter on curly hair than straight ones. Sulphate shampoos make my curls look bouncy, springy, fresh, lively and voluminous. To me, there’s no competition. Some styles look better with curly hair, like pinning your hair to the side or putting it.</p>
