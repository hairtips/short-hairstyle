<p>It is a common problem for the top layer of fine hair to be damaged—it takes all of the abuse. Frizzy/puffy hair is a definite sign of a lack of moisture &amp; along w/the frizziness comes dry/brittle hair, split ends/damaged hair shaft, which causes the hair to be very porous.so to remedy this you would want to look at your current hair products &amp; quite possibly change them up.for ex: So i undo the bottom and keep trying over and over, trying to making it as tight as possible, but it doesn�t make a difference! When your hair is cut wet, it’s shorter than you wanted once it dries.</p>
<h3 id="but-as-those-whove-gone-the-platinum-route-can-attest-the-double-processing-does-change-the-texture-of-your-hair">But as those who’ve gone the platinum route can attest, the double processing does change the texture of your hair.</h3><p>Natural oils are responsible for locking in moisture, so once these are gone, your hair will dry out fast. In case you prefer your hair straight and have no love for its natural texture, one of the best ways of controlling fluffy hair would be to learn how to blow dry it properly. I can do a french braid perfectly, until i get to the very bottom (bottom of my scalp, that is). That said, if you are dead set against it, the only way to get rid of it—with your current method of styling—is to cut your hair above your shoulders. Your shampoo is clarifying (this can be very harsh on your hair if used on a reg basis) , ex #2: Using a shampoo such as carol�s daughter hair milk will both cleanse the hair without any.</p>

<p>I have a layer of hair that is always less curly, maybe a 2a underneath, but my hair underneath is more of a 2c/3a, i was thinking about getting leyers if they would help, or going curly girl.

<p>If i cut all my hair without being mindful, it could end up the same length and still be a poofy mess.

<p>I also flip my hair from one side part to another a lot, so that may be whats messing with it. Natural oils are responsible for locking in moisture, so once these are gone, your hair will dry out fast. Cutting long, soft layers like these cuts would help rectify this, exposing the healthy hair underneath: However, gray hair tends.</p>

<p>My hair is easily weighed down by water and if i come/brush it while it�s wet and leave it that way it will dry all nasty and poofy. Your roots are dying faster because your body heat is causing the color to process faster at the roots. Broken brushes, lost bobby pins, humidity frizz, not to mention the triangle effect..</p>

<p>Comb the section out so that the hair is smooth and even. So i undo the bottom and keep trying over and over, trying to making it as tight as possible, but it doesn�t make a difference!

<p>It also won�t disrupt the natural curl pattern of your hair. Consider letting your hair air dry.
