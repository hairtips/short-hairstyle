<p>Why you shouldn’t brush wavy hair. Wavy hair follicles tend to have an “s” shape. I also prefer a t shirt over a microfiber towel, for some reason, i get less frizz. Just as curly hairs typically curl the most when wet, humidity in the air brings out waves or curls in hair. Hormones are the main reason why your.</p>

<p>I shampoo, condition, squish to condish (great for getting curls and waves to clump), and apply medium hold gel to mostly wet hair. First, because straight hair can be better customized when the stylist does the styling, it can be curled to all different waves at will, making it easier to create a voluminous style. So if you lived in.</p>

<p>When my hair is wet, it gets really curly, but by the time it�s dry, most, if not all, of my curls are gone. Like silicone, it causes the hair to dry out quickly. My whole life, my hair has been wavy when wet but straight once dry. Wet and wavy hair droplets are made to rotate when wet, and.</p>

<p>I did this, and i saw more waves and more defined waves in my hair than before, but the difference was fairly subtle. This may be from water weighing hair down as it dries, or from hair being brushed or combed. This could have a lot to do with your washing and styling techniques. When the muscles change in the.</p>

<p>Why you shouldn’t brush wavy hair. This is why a wavy hair needs a gel or mousse to hold the texture when the hair dries (a slightly different principle to when your hair is straight and curled in the shower). The reason for this is that curly hair reacts differently to humidity than straight hair. Off it went into the.</p>

<p>Why hair is wavy when wet but dries straight. I shampoo, condition, squish to condish (great for getting curls and waves to clump), and apply medium hold gel to mostly wet hair. This is normally because the water makes your hair heavy and stretched, so it dries straight. The first encounter you’ll have is during puberty. The waves are pretty.</p>

<p>I shampoo, condition, squish to condish (great for getting curls and waves to clump), and apply medium hold gel to mostly wet hair. Often wavy hair needs support from gel or mousse to maintain its texture as it dries. It is straight and flat but has some volume.
