How to blowdry curly hair From justcurly.com</p>
<p>Why is my blonde hair so frizzy? This can happen because you�re not using products correctly, your curls are damaged, or you�re using harsh products on your strands. This is normally because the water makes your hair heavy and stretched, so it dries straight. While a frizzy patch of hair may look curly, frizz also happens to straight hair.</p>
<h3 id="dry-hair-is-one-of-the-leading-causes-of-wet-frizz">Dry hair is one of the leading causes of wet frizz.</h3><p>When your cuticles are open, moisture gets into the hair strands, expanding the hair as it dries, leading to frizz. The main reason dry hair becomes frizzy is that the strands project away from the main body of the hair seeking moisture. This can happen because you�re not using products correctly, your curls are damaged, or you�re using harsh products on your strands. Use a really nourishing hair mask every week like coco &amp; eve like a virgin super nourishing coconut &amp; fig hair masque (£32.90). This is why a wavy hair needs a gel or mousse to hold the texture when the hair dries (a slightly different principle to when your hair is straight and curled in the shower). Water weight can ruin your waves.</p>
