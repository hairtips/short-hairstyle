<p>Your hair texture changes during menopause. How quickly curly hair grows the fact of the matter is that curly hair takes a longer time to grow longer because it grows in a curl, rather than straight down. When hair is really long the roots can get pulled out by the weight of the hair but oftentimes the ends still curl.</p>
