<p>Studying the ultrastructural arrangement of fibres, the authors observed the presence of four. Curly and wavy hair is like that because it wants moisture.

<p>This is why a wavy hair needs a gel or mousse to hold the texture when the hair dries (a slightly different principle to when your hair is straight and curled in the shower). This coupled with gravity straightens your curls. When it comes to curly hair, the technique matters a lot. Shrinkage is what you call the difference between.</p>

<p>Having hair that looks straight but is poofy. Blow drying will help keep your curls from getting weighed down while waiting to dry. Why does wavy hair dry straight?

<p>Kindly suggest me the best shampoos , conditioners, and leave in for dry 2a/2b wavy hair. This distributes the conditioner properly throughout your hair, keeps the curl clumps together and reduces frizz. Brushing dry curls is generally not recommended because when your hair is dry, it’s not as elastic. Often wavy hair needs support from gel or mousse to maintain.</p>
