</center> <p><strong>How To Cut Long Hair At Home Straight</strong>, If you want to feather your ends, hold the scissors vertically and cut upwards. This can take a fair bit of practice.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="100%" src="https://hairtips.github.io/img/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=how%20to%20cut%20long%20hair%20at%20home%20straight" alt="How to cut your own hair straight!" title="How to cut your own hair straight!" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https:\/\/hairtips.github.io\/img\/placeholder.svg';" class="center" />
How to cut your own hair straight! From cutiefulchristina.com</p>
<p>When the hair is wet, it lays flat and there are no flyaways so not only is it easier to cut but you are more apt to cut it evenly. Then, carefully comb the section of hair you want to cut. Place two fingers on either side of your hair above the second elastic band. To cut your long bangs at home, try layering them with the twist technique.</p>
<h3 id="for-the-back-with-longer-hair-if-you-want-to-shape-around-the-front-pull-it-all-forward-and-follow-the-line-that-was-there-already">For the back, with longer hair, if you want to shape around the front, pull it all forward and follow the line that was there already.</h3><p>There is a long circle cut, in which the hair is cut to uniform lengths so that if all the hairs were to stand straight out from the head it would form a circular halo of hair. Keep checking with the hand mirror as you go! First of all, to be calm, cut not more than an inch in 1 step, and keep hair straight before cutting (you may even flat iron it). Pull that hair straight up, then twist it forward. You will see the sharp difference in hair lengths. Point the tips of your shears upward toward the very ends of your bangs and make tiny snips at the ends.</p>
