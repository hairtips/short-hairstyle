<p>Unless medically necessary it’s normally not recommended to shave a dog with a double coat down to the skin because it can expose their skin to harmful uv rays which can cause serious burns. Tampering with it by shaving it all off will leave your dog feeling hotter than when he had his coat. Brushing/trimming out the mats isn’t even an option. As mentioned, your dog’s coat contains two distinct layers.</p>
<h3 id="as-mentioned-you-should-never-shave-a-dog-with-a-double-coat">As mentioned, you should never shave a dog with a double coat.</h3><p>The undercoat is shorter and grows faster, and also turns over, or sheds, twice a year. This will undoubtedly give your house a new fur carpet. The only time shaving should be done is when it’s absolutely necessary. If you do shave your double coated dog, the new hair will grow back but the undercoat will grow first. Dogs with double coats also tend to have more sensitive skin, so they are more prone to getting sunburned. The outer coat is longer, and tends to grow slower.</p>

The texture of the soft undercoat will absorb the sun’s rays, making your dog hotter in summer. If you do not routinely brush your dog’s coat the shed hairs will become caught up in the coat, causing uncomfortable mats and.</p>
