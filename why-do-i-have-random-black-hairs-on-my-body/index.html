<p>Women produce mainly oestrogen but also small amounts of testosterone. Not all hairs on my upper lip though, some only. My problem is with my body hair. The human body is actually fully covered with hair, but most of this hair is very short, fine, and thin, and invisible in all but the brightest of lights. To dye your hair.</p>

The best explanation as to what these hairs are and why they develop is due to genetic mutations that occur in. For many women longer, blacker hairs on.</p>
