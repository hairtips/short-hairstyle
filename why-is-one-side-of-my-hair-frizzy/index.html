<p>Since you are experiencing dryness in the back of your hair, you can concentrate this on the problem area. Blow drying it makes it worse. Frizzy hair, also called frizz, happens when the cuticle layer of each strand of your hair opens up, allowing the moisture from the air to pass through and swell all the strands. By infusing moisture.</p>

<p>Also, why is only the top layer of my hair frizzy? This is because of the lack of adequate nutrients absorbed into your body. Because the cuticle is thinner, it. I then brush the newly flattened section with conair® velvet touch large paddle brush ($4.50). Low oil production means hair has less natural moisture, so it tends to be coarse.</p>

<p>The only thing i can suggest is perhaps give it a nice trim to kind of even it out. “as a result, a humid environment makes overdried hair frizzy [because] the outer layer starts soaking the moisture from the air and swells.” washing your hair in very hot water But one of the biggest factors for a complete shift in.</p>

<p>If you have gray hair, you need to treat it the same as anyone born with dry, frizzy. Use a really nourishing hair mask every week like coco &amp; eve like a virgin super nourishing coconut &amp; fig hair masque (£32.90). I have tried so many products claiming to tame the frizz but nothing works. Your skin is also likely.</p>

<p>I also have cowlicks in the front that make me crazy as it creates a very unattractive shape for my hairline. It frizzes terribly in the slightest humidity.

<p>I�ve noticed that no matter what i do, my face framing and curls on the side of my head are much curlier than the curls on the back of my head. But i also haven’t figured out how to give the straight side more volume so my hair just ends up looking uneven. Also, why is only the top layer.</p>
