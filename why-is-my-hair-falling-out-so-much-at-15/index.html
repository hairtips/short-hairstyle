<p>My brother says i shed like a dog. Have you been shedding hair? We often forget that what happens on the outside of our bodies, such as hair loss, is sometimes a direct result of what’s going on inside of our bodies.

<p>One common cause of hair loss is hormonal changes. While not impossible, it�s also quite rare for a 13 year old to suffer the effects of androgenic alopecia (genetic balding). I have long blonde hair, i�m 15 years old. So any more than that and you could risk some strands falling out. As i noticed extra strands with each run.</p>

<p>After experiencing thinning and postpartum hair loss, i spent many months testing different products and home care techniques to combat the issues i was having.

<p>The first step to remedying teenage hair loss is to find the cause of the problem. Puberty can cause temporary excess shedding during the teen years. Simplest things like hairstyles to adverse chemical processes on the hair can make the hair fall out. One morning as i was combing my hair preparing for work, i noticed some hair falling out.</p>

<p>Good looks start on the inside. However, it�s highly unlikely that your balding is due to dandruff. As i noticed extra strands with each run of the comb!!! I don�t know, but my hair always falls out too. This reduces hair breakage caused by static electricity from plastic combs.</p>

<p>After a lot of trial and error, i was able to prevent my curly hair from falling out and promote new hair growth. This reduces hair breakage caused by static electricity from plastic combs.

<p>Nutritional deficiencies can cause hair to fall out. It can also be caused by shortages of other nutrients, including b vitamins and vitamin d. I don�t know, i never really worried about it though. Good looks start on the inside.
