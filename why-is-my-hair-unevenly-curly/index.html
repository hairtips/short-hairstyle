<p>If your hair was really long before you shaved it, it would appear slightly less curly because of the weight pulling it down, but it would not go from curly to straight. Hair loss is a condition that all individuals can face regardless of whether they are young, old, men, women. In turn, once the top layer dries up, curly.</p>

For some time, your hair will remain straight until such a stage in life or old age you realize your hair has lost its straightness and has begun to curl. Directly, pollution won’t cause a change in your.</p>

<p>This can be something you are born with or your hair texture and wave pattern can change due to hormones or certain illnesses and medications. Why is my hair so frizzy? My journey to embracing my natural texture and natural curl pattern has not been an easy or a short road. The shaft of your hair affects how curly it.</p>
