Tighter curls in particular work especially well when you twist them before bed. You can use a silk scrunchie to hold your curls up, then wrap your sides in a silk scarf to keep them protected.</p>
<h3 id="it039s-all-about-figuring-out-how-to-sleep-with-your-hair-so-that-you-arent-left-with-creases-frizz-or-flattened-curls-the-next-morning">It�s all about figuring out how to sleep with your hair so that you aren’t left with creases, frizz, or flattened curls the next morning.</h3><p>To protect your curls while you sleep, try one of these easy ways to sleep with curly hair. But when you do your wash routine at night and go to bed with a gel cast (maybe pull your hair into a pineapple), the cast preserves your curls. Sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase; Pile your curls on the very top of your head, which will protect them and also be the most comfortable way to sleep. For loose wavies this will give you tighter curls, and for tighter curl patterns this will stretch your hair. Do your hair a favour and apply your favourite hair oil on your ends before wearing a satin bonnet or putting your hair in a protective hairstyle.</p>
