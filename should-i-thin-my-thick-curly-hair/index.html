<p>How to get thicker hair? If someone with a ton of curly hair is really thinned out you won�t notice it quite as much as someone who has finer more straight hair,. • thick hair tends to be especially strong, which means that it contains more protein in its cortex compared to finer hair. I have ringlet curls that are really fine and thin (when i straighten my hair, it’s slippery), and naturally dark blonde hair that makes my hair look thinner than it is.</p>
<h3 id="you-have-a-wonderful-hair-color-that-looks-great-in-curls">You have a wonderful hair color that looks great in curls.</h3><p>Why do you want to thin. I currently have layers on long and super thick curly hair, and had them when my hair was a bit shorter (like just past my shoulder) as well as when my hair was much longer. Thinning shears risks for curly &amp; frizzy hair types making cuts with hair thinning scissors causes curly hair to become more frizzy and prone to split ends and breakage of the curl which, let’s be real, no curly haired woman wants their hair to break off.the reason lies within the hair. Especially if your hair’s thick. So here are my tips for thick curly or wavy hair care: Apply conditioner to the ends.</p>

<p>Moving your part more to the centre will work well with a long face.

<p>However, you want to bear in mind when you start talking to your stylist that when you cut the length of curly hair, you remove weight which may be helping to stretch out the curl to some degree.
