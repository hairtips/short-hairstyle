</center> <p><strong>Why Did My Hair Get Curly As I Got Older</strong>, But even though we might know what affects hair texture, it is still unclear exactly how and why this happens. During menopause, numerous hormonal changes occur in your body that starts to show on the outside, and this includes hair becoming dry and wiry as you get older.</p>

<p>Sulfates strip and dehydrate your strands, causing them to. Now, curly hair is clearly not a bad thing, but in my case, the curl began at the root while the length was still flat. It’s all down to the fact that there are several different chemicals in our body that are responsible for our hair colour. I am 100 percent guilty of changing my hair colour as if it were as humdrum as changing my socks.</p>
<h3 id="my-hair-was-curly-until-i-was-about-6-then-it-got-wavy-then-got-curly-again-at-about-16">My hair was curly until i was about 6, then it got wavy, then got curly again at about 16.</h3><p>The change of muscle tone could affect the shape of your hair follicles and their direction of growth. My hair was curly until i was about 6, then it got wavy, then got curly again at about 16. I had naturally very unruly curly hair which i have always loved, wash and wear, , as it grew longer and i got older ( almost 60) the curl was not as good , so decided to have a spiral perm to give it some shape and style. When i let my hair air dry, it turns into this awkward frizzy straight hair with wavy pieces but when it’s wet, it’s so wavy it’s almost curly. They don’t grow as quickly and this can make curly hair straighter. Don�t try change your hair!</p>
