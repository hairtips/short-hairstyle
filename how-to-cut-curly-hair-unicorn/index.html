Unicorn Cut Anleitung Deutsch From ausma-bilder.blogspot.com</p>
<p>A deva cut is a haircut specifically for naturally curly hair (from wavy to super curly!). I�ve done it a couple of times with 2c/3a curls. Tie all your hair in a ponytail just before the crown of your head. Cut the hair just above the second band.</p>
<h3 id="please-watch-my-two-month-update-before-cutting">Please watch my two month update before cutting!</h3><p>After you ve cut off this length undo your hair ties and divide your hair into 4 sections for layering with 2 sections. Next, like the unicorn method, use four more bands and tie each section at the length you want to cut your hair. Make a bump free high ponytail. The hair is first washed and cared for, then cut wet. I did it again another unicorn. The plump method is a styling technique for people with naturally curly hair to create big, bouncy and fluffy curls.</p>
