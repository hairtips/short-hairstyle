Should a girl put her hair up in a ponytail or down? Does From quora.com</p>
<p>It’s actually better if you sleep with your hair up, rather than down. Whether your tresses are wrapped up tight or hang down your back, the piecey layered look teamed with waves is always going to be a magnet for compliments. Choose an asymmetrical style for short hair. Personally i have very very long hair &amp; every time i go swimming, i put my hair up in a bun or use a silicone cap like prof swimmers.</p>
<h3 id="sleeping-with-your-hair-down-seems-like-the-most-natural-way-to-go-but-can-actually-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-especially-if-you-have-long-hair">Sleeping with your hair down seems like the most natural way to go but can actually be doing more harm than good, especially if you have long hair.</h3><p>When going out to a fancy dinner or a wedding it looks great up. If you wear your hair up in a ponytail every single day, your hair will probably get more tangled than if you left it down, especially if you leave it up in the same ponytail multiple days in a row. During your interview, you don�t want to be worrying about pushing your hair out of your face. Instead of wearing your hair down, wear a classy bun or ponytail, or twist your hair into a smooth, long braid to keep your hair away from your face. This helps your helmet lie flat and it will not bobble. Tease the top section of your hair.</p>
