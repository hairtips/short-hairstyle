<p>And while inhaling more male pheromones may be soothing to women, inhaling too many female pheromones can result in tipping the scale from being aroused to being grossed out. Sometimes idols won�t have armpit hair (where even relatively hairless people have this). I don�t particularly like armpit hair, but if a guy shaved his armpit hair i would wonder why, seeing as it is not the social norm, he is just choosing to do it. Why do men like woman�s hairy armpits do they?</p>

<p>Should guys have armpit hair? Some answers are shockingly interesting! Terminal hair that grows in the armpits, like pubic hair, is also called “ambisexual hair”. Generally speaking, guys look more attractive when they tame body hair, and the armpits are part of that equation. Do guys care about dark.</p>

<p>Some answers are shockingly interesting! Different from vellus hair because it’s longer. Armpit hair works like a scent diffuser, allowing more pheromones to affect surrounding males and females.

<p>Manscaping is more popular than ever, with most men choosing to shave parts of their body for various reasons. However, while studies show that some women prefer men who manscape, there are many others who like their men to have more hair than they do. And no, not because we feel obliged to abide by their preferences, but simply out.</p>

<p>Is it ok to show armpit hair?

<p>Personally, i prefer guys who have natural armpit hair, however it�s up to them whether to keep or shave or trim their pit hair, it�s their body after all. You’re a member of a very small club. Level 2 · 6 yr. Some answers are shockingly interesting! That�s just because they�ve been conditioned to think that women shouldn�t have hair.</p>

<p>Settling for just a quick trim can go a long way, while still minimizing the odor from your pits.

<p>So, our general advice is to groom the pits, but there are reasons to stick to a trim and avoid a total shave. Is there a purpose for armpit hair? I don�t mind some leg hair (as long as it�s not coarse and thick like mine) or arm hair, and i�m certainly not against pubic hair. Yes, men should absolutely.</p>

<p>And only 6 percent of men want their women. This means that it’s present in both males and females.

Sometimes idols won�t have armpit hair (where even relatively hairless people have.</p>

<p>I wouldn�t be surprised if some of them have a little bit of chest hair they get waxed. But i�m a guy, a girl not removing her armpits is not feminine.

<p>Similar results were first found in a 1953 paper. Hair can be perceived as a manly trait but only in moderation. I don�t mind some leg hair (as long as it�s not coarse and thick like mine) or arm hair, and i�m certainly not against pubic hair. This means that it’s present in both males and females. But they do.</p>

<p>Then again, there are men like mechanic 32 who do like it. Should guys have armpit hair? However, while studies show that some women prefer men who manscape, there are many others who like their men to have more hair than they do. A little bit of growth is absolutely fine, even when you�re shirtless on the beach playing volleyball..</p>

<p>A little bit of growth is absolutely fine, even when you�re shirtless on the beach playing volleyball. Should guys have armpit hair? I am under the impression that many (most?) men in the usa do not like them. I like hairy men, but super thick/voluminous armpit hair can be gross. A whopping 46 percent of males want their female partner.</p>

<p>They say its not manly. I think guys who take a larger interest than average over their appearance can be a bit vain / fake, the same as girls who spend a lot of time preening / fake tanning etc. Armpit hair works like a scent diffuser, allowing more pheromones to affect surrounding males and females. I wouldn�t be surprised.</p>

<p>And no, not because we feel obliged to abide by their preferences, but simply out of sheer curiosity now that we all gained pube autonomy and our current lack of waxing appointments have encouraged us to. I personally do trim my armpits. Different from vellus hair because it’s longer. Do guys care about dark. But they do a little bit.</p>

<p>Frankly, i�ve even found some girls look cute with that really thin moustache some girls with dark hair and really light skin grow. I personally do trim my armpits. Just out of interest, and after a rather hilarious debate about the state of our own body hair on our morning zoom call, glamour asked the men in our lives for.</p>
