<p>Half of guys prefer wavy. Wavy hair normally has plenty of body and naturally holds volume, hence every man’s hairstyle works for this texture. Slight dislike of very short hair, but no strong preference beyond that. Little things like whether to keep your hair straight or not won�t matter. I�ve never said im not gonna talk to a.</p>

<p>For a split second he thought it was a guy. I love curly hair, but it just makes me feel disproportionately large on top, so i stick to sleek, straight hair lol. I�ve had men ask me in almost disgusted tones why i perm my hair. Wavy hair normally has plenty of body and naturally holds volume, hence every man’s.</p>

<p>What man could resist a woman like this? Men find long, wavy locks the sexiest hair style on a woman, according to a poll. Funny how it works but kinda true.
