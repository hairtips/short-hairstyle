<p>Your hairstylist should be able to help you. Think i should get layers with curly hair? If you are wondering how a layered hairstyle will work with your curls, let us find that out here. Layers work on curly hair of all lengths and levels of thickness, regardless of if you have a textured pixie or long, wavy princess locks.</p>
<h3 id="layers-can-help-natural-hair-achieve-the-volume-and-texture-that-you039re-hoping-for">Layers can help natural hair achieve the volume and texture that you�re hoping for.</h3><p>Having curly hair can even feel like a whole new language that you have to learn, decode, and follow. They’re a great idea if you’re looking to develop some shape or get some volume into those curls of yours. You can grow your hair into long waist length curls without the traingle effect if you have thin hair. I wanted the extra volume. If you’ve ever suffered from unruly, frizzy curls, a layered cut is a great way to take back some control and maintain a shape. If hair volume and body is what you want from your curly hair then adding uniform layers (pictured left) throughout your hair will balance out the body and volume, while layers cut through the sides and back of curly hair (pictured right) will.</p>

<p>My first clue as to why you shouldn�t get layers was how quickly my hair fell flat after i got my cut. If you want to keep your hair long, be careful about too many layers.
