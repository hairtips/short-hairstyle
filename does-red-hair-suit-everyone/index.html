Why Red Hair Can Suit Everyone BEAUTY/crew From beautycrew.com.au</p>
<p>This red hair color is a stunning choice for all the brave ladies out there that want to turn heads. It suits pretty much everyone. There are several renditions of red hair, that suit every skin tone and texture — it�s about finding the color that works for you, whether it�s a scarlet hue or a golden copper. All you need to do is tailor the shade to your skin tone.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-have-red-hair">Do you have red hair?</h3><p>Fringes come in all types of shapes and cuts, and there are some that can suit everyone, with others being a little harder to pull off, depending on your face shape and how you style your hair. If the measurement of where the pencil meets the ruler is lesser than 2.25 inches, then short hair will suit your face. The ruler and pencil will now create a “t region” with each other. In the middle ages and beyond, redheads acquired even more negative connotations. Then you’ll be the subject of serious hair envy. Red hair is actually the most versatile.</p>
