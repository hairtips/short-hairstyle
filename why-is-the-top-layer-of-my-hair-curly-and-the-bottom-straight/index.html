<p>I think the moisture of my wet hair, paired with the fact that it is so close to my face (body heat) makes a sort of humid hair climate, so the parts of my ahir that are closer to my head are more. Cutting long, soft layers like these cuts would help rectify this, exposing the healthy hair underneath: When i stopped the heat. To combat this, the usual advice from stylists is choppy layers, to make the underneath not so heavy.</p>

I have a similar issue. I cut my curly hair right above the shoulder. The question of why hair curls at the end and other relevant questions will be answered today. As type 2 and 3 hair grows longer, the weight of the hair can elongate curls, which. It’s true for me as well.</p>

<p>Great layered hair depends on a variety of things, such as hair length, strand thickness and face shape. If you have strong hair and my hair is straight on top and curly on bottom you can choose to cut the pixie hairstyle in order to increase the size and increase the thickness of the hair. Why does this differentiation happen.</p>

<p>I’ve seen it described that the top layer is like an umbrella. Welcome to our hair consultations column. This typically happens because of heat damage from straightening or blow drying.

<p>The top portion of your hair can get easily damaged. It starts with your genetics. It takes all the weather and damage so it takes longer for the top layer to adapt to curly. The top layer of your hair is straight and curly underneath because you probably have a mixed hair type. This is when wavy or curly hair.</p>

<p>Straight hair can become greasy and limp quickly, so it’s important that it is washed frequently; And that’s the natural behaviour, so embrace it :).
