<p>I prefer to keep my head shaved rather than buzzed. Should i buzz it or try and resalvage it by going on some fin and monix. Make money or help a charity 6. So i�m really scared to buzz, but also unhappy how i am.</p>
<h3 id="he-is-the-perfect-role-model-for-you-guys-who-are-seriously-losing-your-hair">He is the perfect role model for you guys who are seriously losing your hair.</h3><p>This is generally a good choice, as most people find the remnant of a full head of hair less attractive and less masculine than either alternative.
