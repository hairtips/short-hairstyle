</center> <p><strong>Why Is Only One Side Of My Hair Wavy</strong>, It’s suspected this kind of change happens from hormones, though other things can coax it along. My current routine is to dry it with a t shirt, put in some leave in conditioner to make it soft, and then comb it out.</p>

<p>The constant pressure and friction can, over time, either make your thinner side much weaker or the thicker side can become more damaged over time. So i would have some waves if i kept my hair short, but if i grew it out very much, there were no waves to be found. It�s wavy with ringlets at the bottom. If your wavy hair tends to be on the straight side, your hair may lack volume.</p>
<h3 id="this-means-that-most-crowns-grow-out-in-a-spiral-towards-the-right">This means that most crowns grow out in a spiral towards the right.</h3><p>If i try to straighten the wavy side, it looks like a frizzy, damaged mess. That still only does so much. And i have bangs that i keep to the side. I�m not sure if she is right, but i am glad i am not the only one with the problem! Those straight hairs fall to each side (right and left) and cover my curly hair. It almost makes me not want to wear my hair curly sometimes because it just looks so weird to have beautiful coils on one side and almost bone straight hair on the other side.</p>
