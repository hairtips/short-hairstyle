<p>I was wondering about the rest of the verse. To wear it long is a glory to her; Most people braid their hair because they think “god looks only at the heart”. While it is certainly not wrong to forego cosmetics, using them with wisdom and modesty is not a sin. The sight of men with long hair would definitely.</p>

<p>No, it is not a sin according to the word of god.

<p>If someone keeps his hair long to emulate the prophet (peace be upon him) and take care of it and care about hygiene of them, then it’s ok. The same is not true today.

<p>“paul is saying that by nature a man feels shameful for wearing culturally defined symbols of womanhood.” human males, left to nature, will have just as much hair on their heads as women, and more hair on their faces.

<p>Typically and historically, it has been women who wear earrings. Saint paul just asked a question regarding long hair and did not make it a command. Not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; While it is certainly not wrong to forego cosmetics, using them with wisdom and modesty is not a sin. A tunic or coat,.</p>
