<h3 id="some-women-have-fine-hair-but-a-lot-of-it-and-may-need-their-hair-thinned-out-to-get-rid-of-some-of-the-bulk">Some women have fine hair but a lot of it and may need their hair thinned out to get rid of some of the bulk.</h3><p>This can easily be done by twisting a curl and snipping off a small amount at a time. Do you see how rare the ends look, even if she tried to obtain volume by waving it? Go for straight and blunt cuts or stacked layers because they can help you solve any thin hair problems. A trim, to improve the cut, should make the layers closer, balance them out, and blend them more. As the layers grow and start to match up it will start to feel thicker.
