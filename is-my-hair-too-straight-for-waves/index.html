<p>If i don’t use a product with hold such as gel or mousse, my hair won’t be truly straight, but it won’t have defined waves. Follow your usual routine for washing your hair. This is the most tenacious of all straight hair types, but it’s also a bit more difficult to manage, because of its thickness. You’ll do this until.</p>

<p>Whenever i try and style it as wavy\curly hair the straight pieces do not cooperate, and when i brush it out like straight hair all my waves are defined on the bottom and the top gets frizzy. The best method for making your curls stick the next day is to shower the night before and wait until your hair is.</p>

<p>If it is curlier you will be more prone to frizz and dryness so opt for products that will smooth your hair and define your natural wave such as texturising spray or smoothing serum. How my hair looked when wet was another sign that it was naturally wavy, not straight. 1a is the rarest hair type. I used plush to.</p>

<p>Now i had considered my hair to be straight, however i always use straighteners because if i did’t it would go frizzy. The good news for those with wavy or curly hair is that you could wake up one day and find that your hair has gone from straight to curly or vice versa. Ugh… i wish i had pin.</p>

<p>It doesn’t even hold a curl! Makes the body straight and the ends curl which is very playful around the shoulders. Now i had considered my hair to be straight, however i always use straighteners because if i did’t it would go frizzy. In fact, too much brushing can cause the hair to get thinner, and it makes it feel.</p>

<p>The ideal solution is to hydrate the hair every two weeks with products like murumuru care mask formulated with murumuru butter and with repairing, nourishing properties. Long and layered is the way to go here, otherwise it might be a little too hard to handle. This is the most tenacious of all straight hair types, but it’s also a bit.</p>

<p>Scrunch your hair in the same upward motion to help maintain the shape it dried in naturally (seeing a pattern here?!). I believe that i have possibly done the same. Wash and dry your hair. Long and layered is the way to go here, otherwise it might be a little too hard to handle. Wear your hair in a braid.</p>

<p>1c hair is straight but thick and coarse. If i don’t use a product with hold such as gel or mousse, my hair won’t be truly straight, but it won’t have defined waves. When it comes to wavy hair, there are types 2a, 2b, and 2c. Long and layered is the way to go here, otherwise it might be a.</p>

<p>Wavy hair can have the same problems as straight and curly hair, including excess sebum (since it often has a straight root) and dehydrated ends, especially type 2c hair. Whenever i try and style it as wavy\curly hair the straight pieces do not cooperate, and when i brush it out like straight hair all my waves are defined on the.</p>
