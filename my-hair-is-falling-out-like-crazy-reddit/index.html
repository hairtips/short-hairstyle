<p>I haven�t been experimenting with shampoos or conditioners much. It could be sudden stress, sudden change in climate, fungal infection, etc. My hair was like that, but i had so much hair it didn’t make a difference (although the amount of hair loss was concerning lol). I seal the infusium 23 with olive oil, or tea. I bun my hair.</p>
