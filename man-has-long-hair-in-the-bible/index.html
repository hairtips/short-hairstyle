For if woman was made originally for man, no man is now born except by a woman, and both man and woman, like everything else, owe their existence to god.</p>
<h3 id="the-female-gender-generally-had-long-hair">The female gender generally had long hair.</h3><p>This is not to indicate what the bible teaches regarding men�s hair, but rather the most likely deduction to answer whether jesus had long hair during his time on earth. The male gender generally had short hair; So a women takes her hair, wraps it up, and puts it on her head for a covering. Let us be glad together and praise dagon. In an answer to a previous question we found that scripture prohibits men from looking like women and women from looking like men. That was the prearranged signal judas had given so that the guards could identify jesus.</p>

<p>For samson renewed his vow to the lord. We are to worship god in spirit and in truth, obey the law and offer justice in a fair and balance way (john 4:24). Most jewish men had shorter hair.

<p>This corresponds to the corinthian tradition of men not wearing a head covering during worship. The bible insists on a distinction between male and female, involving not only their distinct characters and roles but also their outward appearance. Men more naturally have shorter, thinner hair (and are much more prone to baldness), therefore it would be odd for a man.</p>

<p>Of course, in the sight of god neither “man” nor “woman” has any separate existence. However, there are verses that describe how jewish men took care of their hair according to the law. For the man’s part, it is unnatural for him to have “long hair” (verse 14). Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has.</p>

<p>And if a woman has long hair, it is an esteem to her, because the long hair has been given to her over against a veil. Based on these verses, jesus likely had neatly trimmed black hair, long sideburns, and a beard. Long hair is a gift to women. This includes treating each other with love as we would like.</p>

<p>Men more naturally have shorter, thinner hair (and are much more prone to baldness), therefore it would be odd for a man to wear a veil or have long hair (verse 14). That pretty much means that the growing bald of the individual male symbolizes humanity�s evolving readiness to receive (=uncover/discover) christ, and the long cranial hair of a woman.</p>

<p>And if a woman has long hair, it is an esteem to her, because the long hair has been given to her over against a veil. Every church must implement this distinction.
