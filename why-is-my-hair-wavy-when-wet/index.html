<p>Then try squishing your conditioner in an upward motion into your hair. My hair is fine, blonde, and usually wavy. Start with a really mild creamy shampoo. When you saturate your hair strands with water, you increase the weight of each individual strand.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-have-good-hair-on-wash-day-its-also-really-important-to-sleep-in-a-way-that-protects-your-hair-overnight">If you have good hair on wash day, it’s also really important to sleep in a way that protects your hair overnight.</h3><p>Having hair that looks straight but is poofy is one sign of having wavy hair or curly hair. A brush is an enemy of wavy hair. Brushing naturally wavy hair can flatten it or pull it straight. Wavy hair is a part of the curly hair family, so most maintenance techniques are similar to curly hair. If you are just trying this the first time, you do not have to do that. Get a trim to get rid of your damaged ends, and wash your hair with cold water for a sleek and shiny look.</p>

<p>However, when my hair gets wet with rain water, or my head gets sweaty in the summer, my hair turns from slightly wavy into very wavy with a lot of curls.

<p>Why curly hair looks straight when wet. Usually i plop for around 30 mins so the water is absorbed well, as my hair is very fine and gets weighed down easily.

<p>If you sometimes brush your hair after the shower, and sometimes skip brushing it, this has the potential to make your hair wavy sometimes (when you don’t brush) and straighter sometimes (when you do brush it). How my hair looked when wet was another sign that it was naturally wavy, not straight. This is a bit of an odd one..</p>

<p>You’re just as likely to have waves whether your hair is baby fine or thick. So i would have some waves if i kept my hair short, but if i grew it out very much, there were no waves to be found. I think once i gain some more length, my hair will loosen up again. If you have good.</p>

<p>When wet, your hair becomes heavy and/or stretched. Get a trim to get rid of your damaged ends, and wash your hair with cold water for a sleek and shiny look. Type 2 hair incorporates natural waves that can range from barely noticeable to being mistaken for curly hair. This is why a wavy hair needs a gel or mousse.</p>

<p>I use elvive and leave it in my hair while i finish showering. My hair is quite wavy, even some spirals when wet, and dries almost completely straight (well, there are some bends if i don�t brush it, but it just looks messy). Mine is barely wavy any more if i just air dry. When you saturate your hair strands.</p>

<p>As your hair dries, the water molecules that have been absorbed, are lost and. When conditioning, use your fingers to help keep your hair detangled. Dry, thirsty hair is in search of moisture, which leads to flyaways and frizzy hair even when wet. Nothing special here, i won’t get into ingredients and products that work best for your hair type,.</p>

<p>If you leave your hair down and sleep on a microfleece pillowcase, you’re likely to wake up with your waves flattened and your hair frizzy. Then use a deep conditioner. My hair was always a little wavy, but it was crazy thick when i was a child and adolescent. Most women mistake their wavy hair for curls and frizz. A.</p>

<p>Just wash with shampoo, rinse, then use conditioner, rinse, and then “squish” your hair up to your scalp to see if waves form. Why does wavy hair dry straight? This is a bit of an odd one. Wet frizz can also occur while you are applying your styling products and/or when air drying. I use elvive and leave it in.</p>

<p>My hair is quite wavy, even some spirals when wet, and dries almost completely straight (well, there are some bends if i don�t brush it, but it just looks messy). My hair is fine, blonde, and usually wavy. Good news, this probably means you do have a natural wave to your hair and with some product and technique you could.</p>

<p>Yes, the curly girl method or the cg method is great for those with wavy hair. This coupled with gravity straightens your curls. Then a little trick i have experimented with is putting a fabric headband on while it dries. Why does wavy hair dry straight? Similar to how a curl is made by twisting a lot of hairs around.</p>
