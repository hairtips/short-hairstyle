<p>Those straight hairs fall to each side (right and left) and cover my curly hair. Dryness can cause the hair to be frizzy, resulting in a lack of curl definition, while hair damage can cause the hair to look misshapen from a lack of structure.

<p>I�ve always just put more product in the curlier parts of my hair. To solve this problem, you can choose to straighten or perm to even out the texture of the two layers. It is easier to feel any damp spots, especially in the underlayers, when the hair has been cooled. If the underside of your hair is curlier than.</p>

<p>Yep, my left side has looser curls (3b/3c) and my right side is so much tighter (3c/4a underneath). The top layer of your hair is straight because you may have mixed hair types. Oh the joys of being a curly. Sometimes i want to cry while my hair is drying and i�m just watching the left side slowly straighten out.</p>
