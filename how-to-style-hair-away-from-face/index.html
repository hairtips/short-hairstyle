Try to keep.</p>

<p>Do this by avoiding straight, narrow haircuts and instead offer volume. Of course, one trend doesn�t go away without another one taking its place. First, grab a small section of hair. Choppy bob hairstyles are a great fit for most face shapes and they can add texture to your locks for a better look. A ponytail, a french braid, a.</p>

<p>A centre part and wavy texture works well for long bangs and a ponytail. Start out with the curved side facing out, then flip it across and not only will the curved side face your scalp now, but it will also tighten and hold your hair in place.

<p>Start rolling one section away from your face with your index finger (some find it easier to begin near the temples or hairline), curling inward and even looping twice or thrice around the finger if hair is longer.
