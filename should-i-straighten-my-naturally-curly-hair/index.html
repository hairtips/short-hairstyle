20 Neat and Clean Naturally Curly Hairstyles for Women From hottesthaircuts.com</p>
<p>I used to straighten and color my hair just to fit in with the crowd and i am so happy to be natural now. The heat styling is so infrequent that there is virtually no way straightening your hair one time a hear will damage it—excluding too high heat at once. Be sure to regularly moisturize. Straightening dirty hair with a flat iron will only “cook” oil and dirt in, which will lead to more damage.</p>
<h3 id="i039m-not-a-fan-of-the-diva-cut">I�m not a fan of the diva cut.</h3><p>This is a comment that many women who have natural hair receive, and it is just downright offensive. Natural hair should always be freshly shampooed, conditioned and completely dry before thermal styling. You should leave it curly because when you straighten hair its loner that your natural curly state so if u cut loads off when it straight it will be much shorter. Now glide the straightener down the hair shaft, making sure to move at a continuous, even pace down the section. You can still straighten your hair and be natural. If you have naturally curly hair, you should consider how much your curls will shrink up when it’s cut shorter, sharpton explains.</p>
