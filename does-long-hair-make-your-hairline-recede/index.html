Score 4.4/5 when hair is pulled back in a ponytail, the hairs at the margins.</p>

<p>One of the most important is thinning hair. A mature hairline moves back slightly and usually slower, while a true receding hairline is much more pronounced, usually starting at your temples. Cutting the dread hairline too low will make your hair look unnatural and appear to have a receding hairline. Male pattern baldness can worsen quickly, meaning your hairline may.</p>

<p>There are several best practices for preventing your hair from being ‘trained’ to grow closer to the scalp surface. Stick with short to medium lengths that can be combed forward.
