<p>I had 200 hair clusters glued onto my short hair. Thin the weave using thinning shears. The trick to ensure your hair extensions stay hidden is to clip them in in your ‘safe’ zone, below your eyebrow line, and have enough hair to cover the wefts. This combination of weight and strain on the hair follicles can cause the hair to fall out, which is officially known as traction alopecia.</p>
<h3 id="taking-weight-out-of-the-ends-will-decrease-the-thickness-at-the-bottom-of-your-hair-and-this-could-be-done-at-most-lengths">Taking weight out of the ends will decrease the thickness at the bottom of your hair, and this could be done at most lengths.</h3><p>This technique helps your extensions and hair intertwine naturally. Although not all of these images are your colour or correct texture, they are good examples of shapes. Another cool trick that will completely hide your tapes is teasing your strands in strategic places. Comb the hair as you go, making sure layers are even and lay flat on top of each other. Take one sachet of hairapeutix treatment, and fully coat the hair from the mid lengths to the ends. First, try teasing each section of hair at the root before you clip in your luxies.</p>
