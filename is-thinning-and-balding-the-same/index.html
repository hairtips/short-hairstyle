<h3 id="we-cannot-rule-out-the-fact-that-his-old-man-may-be-balding">We cannot rule out the fact that his old man may be balding.</h3><p>Balding can happen across a span of decades and will slowly make itself present by receding your hairline and thinning your scalp hair over time.

Although there are several ways to stimulate hair regrowth, it can be very difficult to achieve the same volume as before. Thin hair and fine hair are not the same thing. If you’re worried about the roundness of the head as you become balder and balder, the simplest and greatest solution would be to grow a beard.</p>
