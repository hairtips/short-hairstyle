<p>Does hair grow back thinner after shaving head? A lot of people believe shaving off hair from your skin causes the follicles to grow back thicker. Shaving your head reduces the mass of your head and makes it look smaller and this is why you appear slightly more athletic and muscular than you actually are. Shaving has no effect on new growth and doesn’t affect hair texture or density.</p>
<h3 id="so-if-you-are-tired-of-getting-shorter-and-shorter-haircuts-trying-to-mask-the-fact-that-your-hairline-is-reaching-the-top-of-your-head-shaving-is-a-great-option-for-you">So, if you are tired of getting shorter and shorter haircuts trying to mask the fact that your hairline is reaching the top of your head, shaving is a great option for you.</h3><p>The solution to hair fall is not external which most of the people think. Any receding or graying of hair would have occurred even if you never shaved your head. After all, if your receding hairline is messed up or you are developing bald spots at the crown, it might just be better to get a buzz cut or shaved head. As already said, only a theory but for me it sounds plausible. Shaving has no effect on new growth and doesn’t affect hair texture or density. The belief that shaving your head will cause your hair to grow back stronger is just not true.</p>
