grooming a long haired Siamese cat From siameseofday.com</p>
<p>Most cats are meticulous groomers, so they keep their coats in pretty good condition. I�ve always found that grooming a cat with a steel grooming comb works better for me (and the cat) than a wire brush. You can even get densely matted fur and tangles lying close to the skin. If you have a longhaired kitten comb it every day, even tho the coat really doesn�t need it, so it gets used to this routine, as that is.</p>
<h3 id="once-again-we-have-good-news">Once again, we have good news!</h3><p>Does brushing help with cat dandruff? In today�s world, we all have busy schedules that take a lot of time. When you brush your cat regularly, whether that’s once per day or once per week, you can drastically reduce the amount of excess hair that they have on their bodies. Brushing your cat is a fun way to bond with her while keeping her fur and coat healthy. This not only removes the start of any tangles, it also stimulates the oils in the cat�s skin, making their fur shinier, less dry, and less prone to tangles. Just like you brush your hair regularly to untangle any knots and remove dead hair, your cat also depends on you to help out with the task for them.</p>
