<p>For an accurate consultation, it is essential that you select your correct face shape and answer all questions correctly. Adding bouncy waves to this hairstyle is even better as it will give the illusion of width. Your hairdresser should have some idea of what would suit your face (and body) shape best, so remember to include him or her in your decision process. Now, take a bar of soap and outline your face to determine what shape it is.</p>
<h3 id="remember-different-hairstyles-require-different-types-of-maintenance-and-commitment">Remember, different hairstyles require different types of maintenance and commitment.</h3><p>A general rule is that the longer your hair looks the longer your face looks. You need to know how much you will be spending on the hairstyle you pick. One way is to tie your hair back from your face completely (pin up those bangs if you have �em), and look into the mirror. For an accurate consultation, it is essential that you select your correct face shape and answer all questions correctly. The face height is 1.5 times bigger than its width, the widths of forehead and cheekbones are the same, and the chin lines are soft. Now that you know your face shape and how to choose the right hairstyle, why not take a look through thehairstyler.com�s range of hairstyles to suit face shapes?</p>
