<p>Their basis is the bible where peter instructed followers against braiding of the hair (1 peter 3:3).

<p>This is often the most used verse christians use to argue against why other. (1 ti 2:9) do not change the natural. The nazirite vow was a very unusual vow of dedication to god.

<p>Twice in the bible, braided hair is seemingly spurned. Likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives, when they see your respectful and pure conduct.
