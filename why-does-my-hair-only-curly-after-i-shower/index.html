Why does my hair so much more curly when I visit From reddit.com</p>
<p>As you brush your hair, you are breaking that bond. After that,my hair was poker straight. Brushing could be crushing your waves. Something that clumps hair together.</p>
<h3 id="it-sucks-the-moisture-out-of-your-skin-too-fyi-it039s-best-to-use-warm-water-when-you039re-in-the-shower">(it sucks the moisture out of your skin, too, fyi.) it�s best to use warm water when you�re in the shower.</h3><p>There is also an increased risk of fungal infections because of rainwater that can cause the hair to fall and make your scalp itchy. By running a brush through your waves, you are effectively removing their definition that you had worked so hard for in the shower. Before you get out, do a rinse with cold water to prevent frizz. Before starting the curly girl method on the left in both photos, and 2 years into the curly girl method on the right in both photos. Every time i wear like a baseball cap, especially if my hair is a little wet, my hair becomes seemingly straighter and less frizzy. And i need only wear the cap for like 25 minutes or so for this to happen.</p>

<p>The only other times you can comb your curls is after applying a leave in conditioner (explained later in this post) outside the shower and sometimes with oil applied to your hair before you shower. It’s not enough to just condition your hair in the shower. This is just me guessing but baking soda does make my hair curly by.</p>

<p>High levels of stress cause your body to produce more of the stress hormone cortisol. I’ve had surgery off and on my whole life. However, many people don’t know that you can still use your hair after you’ve had a perm. If you’ve ever had a perm, you probably know that the process can be quite damaging to your hair..</p>

<p>How can i get it to be softer and curlier. After that,my hair was poker straight. This is normally because the water makes your hair heavy and stretched, so it dries straight. These basically look like a ladder or dna strand. Keeping the cuticle flat and smooth helps control frizzy hair after a shower.</p>

<p>This leaves my hair moisturized but once it dries it feels a little stiff and doesn’t move much when i shake my head. How can i get it to be softer and curlier.

<p>Hair clumps best when it is soaking wet, so once you are out of the shower, getting wavy hair to clump becomes more difficult.

<p>After a shower, dry hair can be due to your scalp not producing enough oil to moisturize your hair or due to your scalp and hair not holding onto moisture.

<p>The shape of your hair follicles defines your curl pattern and texture, so when your body goes through a major hormonal overhaul, it can also change the shape of your follicles, thus changing your curl pattern.

<p>This is just me guessing but baking soda does make my hair curly by removing anything weighing it down. Stress.stress impacts nearly every part of your body, inside and out.

<p>Conclusion these are the possible ways to stop your hair from clumping together, due to lots of spam comments we have closed the comments section, if you have any doubt.

<p>Either brush or detangle your hair during your shower when you have. The ocean and the pool contain more salt than tap water. Curls need moisture, and using hot water sucks the moisture right out of your strands. Washing them in hot water. I had to have both if my knees operated on, and i had to wear a body.</p>

<p>Your comment was so interesting!! Brushing could be crushing your waves. The water that is still in the hair after the shower encourages the curl to appear. I was born with lose curls.
