<p>I�m having bad tangle problems again and i find that the only solution is to cut my hair like i have in the past. For those of you with fine hair do you find that your hair tangles more when your hair is all one length or when you have layers? If your hair is wavy or curly, adding layers to the hair will allow the shorter layers to curl more and will let you style the hair to add volume and give the appearance. You can grow your hair into long waist length curls without the traingle effect if you have thin hair.</p>
