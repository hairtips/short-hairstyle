The first thing to do, before you even think about how to curl your hair, is prep it. For powerful volume, tip back the head and massage at the roots with your fingertips to loosely separate the curls. If your hair is much longer, it’s probably heavier too.

<p>Choose a side to start on. After removing the hair from the curling iron, hold the curl while it cools to help set the curl. Hold your hair in place around the barrel of the wand for 5 to 15 seconds, depending on how thick your hair is (longer time is necessary for thick hair), and then release the hair.</p>

<p>Take sections that are about 1 1/2 inches wide and slowly wrap the hair around the fattest part of the wand first. You should start from the hair roots and not just the hair tips.

<p>Start with the hair nearest to your face as you move your hair to the back of your head. If your hair is much longer, it’s probably heavier too.

<p>Hold the iron in place for five to seven seconds to allow the heat to penetrate your hair and set the curl. Do this through all the hair sections.
