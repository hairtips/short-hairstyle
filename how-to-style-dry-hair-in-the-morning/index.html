<h3 id="during-the-night-start-with-dry-hair-that-is-either-clean-or-dirty">During the night, start with dry hair that is either clean or dirty.</h3><p>The best way to avoid bed head is to shower in the morning, but you may not have time. Fill your spray bottle with water and a little less than a tablespoon of your favorite conditioner and dampen your hair with the mixture (or wet your hands and smooth or scrunch the water/ and conditioner into your hair.) smoothing will elongate the style while scrunching will create a bit more curl definition. If you�re already waking up early, taking the time to shower and dry your hair each morning may be unrealistic. I go to bed with wet hair and let it dry on its own overnight. To have manageable hair in the morning, make sure your cuticle is closed, or smooth, before bed. Again, we’re avoiding frizz, so each hair type needs to achieve different levels of dryness before combing and adding product.</p>
