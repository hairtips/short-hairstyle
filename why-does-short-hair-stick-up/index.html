<p>It’s not weighty enough to lay flat or slick back. Alternatively, if you went with your natural curls, you could pump up the volume with the aid of a curling iron. Hair that’s too short is more likely to stick up. Otherwise we�d be bald with all the hair we shed out daily and weekly. They’re often caused by breakage.</p>

<p>If it’s too thick, however, it’s less likely to stay flat because the density will push out strays and flyaways. I used to use gel and stuff, but i really don�t like that because it either makes my hair all hard, or. Yes i have the same problem my hair is very thick and even when i straighten it its.</p>

<p>The dense hairs will prop each other up, giving each other strength and support and preventing each other from laying flat. Close the flat iron around the stubborn hair and slowly pull it down. For his first year my son�s hair stuck straight up all over, no matter how short or long it was. I don�t understand how i have.</p>

<p>To use a flat iron correctly on short hairs standing up, wait until you have washed your hair and let it air dry. It also could be because of the way you take care of your hair. You will <em>always</em> have shorter hairs like that on your head, maybe in less noticeable places, but still. When you�re styling your hair,.</p>

<p>Then it got to where it was mostly the crown that stuck up, regardless of length. They�re often caused by breakage and split ends, but also they�re new hairs growing in. I can�t brush it down, because it just pops back up. You can feel this when you run your hands across the side and back of your head after.</p>
