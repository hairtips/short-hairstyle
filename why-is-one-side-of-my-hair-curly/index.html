<p>I cannot express how much rage this sound encites in me. One side of my head is 2c and the other is 3a. Why is only one side of my hair curly #fyp. Hair changing from straight to curly often indicates a hormonal shift within the body. I have tried to leave it alone and let it grow by use.</p>

<p>It almost makes me not want to wear my hair curly sometimes because it just looks so weird to have beautiful coils on one side and almost bone straight hair on the other side. I guess i feel this is one thing many curlies need to just accept. Curly vs straight hair depends on the size of your hair follicle..</p>

<p>Why is only one side of my hair curly #fyp. This difference can result in the outer canopy being damaged and straighter. I hope this makes sense cuz that�s about the best way i know how to explain it. They just chop uneven chunks out of your hair. Did she use thinning shears?</p>

<p>Why is only one side of my hair curly #fyp. You’re inclined to paint with your good hand first.) however, roy. You see the gene for curly hair is not completely dominant. Hormonal changes alter how your genes are expressed, so changes here can make a big difference. Those straight hairs fall to each side (right and left) and cover.</p>

<p>Those straight hairs fall to each side (right and left) and cover my curly hair. At my deva cut, the stylist said to scrunch the wavy side and rake the curlier side.

<p>I cannot express how much rage this sound encites in me. However, sometimes one part of the scalp is exposed to more stresses from the environment and styling than the rest of the head and the hair will behave differently as a result.

<p>Science is a long way off from fully understanding what exactly causes hair to be curly and what factors can turn hair from straight to curly with age. My hair only curls on one side of my head?? It turns out this hair curling issue comes down to dominant hand dexterity and the tendency to do what’s “more comfortable” first..</p>

<p>I have tried to leave it alone and let it grow by use of weaves for a long time. You are far from alone on having to do this. This sounds weird, but maybe try pulling a different direction while drying/straightening? (it’s just like when you paint your nails: You should know that the.</p>
