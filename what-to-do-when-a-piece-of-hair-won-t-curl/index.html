<p>You just wrap the curl and pin it on top of the head to let it set for a few minutes. If your hair is dry and you’re in a bit more of a rush but don’t want to use heat, use a similar method to finger curling. Curls aren’t set until they cool, so while they’re still hot, pin.</p>

<p>Start in the shower by going light on the conditioner. First of all, i am so sorry to hear of your challenge with that pesky patch of hair. Curly hair is a bit more delicate than straight hair, and the tighter the curl or coil, the more fragile the strand. A brush pulls on the curls and undoes them. You.</p>

<p>You just wrap the curl and pin it on top of the head to let it set for a few minutes. The section should be no bigger than 1 in (2.5 cm) so it will hold.

<p>Leaving natural oils in hair, by not washing every day, creates more texture that makes your hair more apt to do what it�s told. Curls aren’t set until they cool, so while they’re still hot, pin them to your head. So, if you want to keep your hair safe from all the damage that curling and straightening potentially does to.</p>

<p>Then, take a bobby pin and secure that little piece of hair in. I�ve found that i�ve been able to get the texture to blend a little bit with tigi control freak serum. If playback doesn�t begin shortly, try restarting your device. Roll each fresh curl around your finger, fasten it to your head with a bobby pin, and then,.</p>

<p>Start in the shower by going light on the conditioner. Do not rub your hair with the towel as this will damage your hair and cause it to look frizzy. Once you get out of the shower, use an absorbent towel to pat your hair dry and squeeze the ends to get excess water out. If i could only give.</p>

<p>Wrap around the hair strand. I recommend setting the hair with pins or clips until it has fully cooled.

<p>It is easier to feel any damp spots, especially in the underlayers, when the hair has been cooled. Take the extra strand of hair and wrap it around to conceal the piece of velcro.
