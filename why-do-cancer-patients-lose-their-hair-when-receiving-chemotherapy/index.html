<p>Why do some chemo patients not lose their hair? While cancer itself doesn’t typically cause hair loss, a common treatment for the disease does.

It can be hard to predict which patients.</p>

<p>Hair loss from chemotherapy or radiation happens when hair follicles are weakened by the treatment. For some, it felt like taking back some control in their lives.

<p>Some types of chemotherapy cause the hair on your head and other parts of your body to fall out. Radiation therapy to your head often causes. Hair loss does not occur with all chemotherapy.

<p>Scalp cooling causes the constriction of blood vessels and hair follicles, which restricts chemo from getting delivered to the hair, said julie nangia, m.d., assistant professor in baylor college. Can cause your hair to fall out, but not all chemotherapy. Hair loss is a common side effect of chemotherapy treatment. This effect is why some patients lose their hair while.</p>

<p>This explains why people have to deal with the loss of their hair. Chemotherapy drugs work by targeting rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells. The chemicals stop cell division in both cancer cells and healthy cells, such as the ones that produce hair. Most women tell me that they are fine for the first couple of weeks, but then.</p>
