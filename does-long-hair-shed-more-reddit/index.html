<p>During catagen and telogen the hair shaft does not grow. I feel when i do it for my hair more hair sheds out. Coming on to these forums you’re fuelling an obsession for something that doesn’t even exist. This is what causes there to be more hair.</p>
<h3 id="you-do-not-start-losing-more-hair-when-your-hair-is-longer--hasn039t-been-cut-for-a-long-time">You do not start losing more hair when your hair is longer / hasn�t been cut for a long time.</h3><p>I�ve had long hair since i was 15, and while i have a receding hairline, i know it�s not affected by my hair. You’re destined to lose these hairs anyway. Either way i didn�t notice an increase in an already extremely fast rate of hair loss. As the cells divide so do you experience rapid growth. Ask family members about any family history of hair problems.” you may have an issue if you’re losing more than 100 hairs. The result is similarly no alopecia development.</p>

<p>It doesn’t actually cause hair loss. Balding is not so much about shedding hair, but about hair not growing back. You can tie it up in a man bun, half up half down, wear a slick back, etc. A single follicle will produce hair for only a fixed amount of time, say 5 years. The ball of shedded hair you.</p>
