<p>So, no, shaving doesn’t cause thicker and better beard, your genetics &amp; hormones are responsible for that matter. I�ve heard that shaving makes hairs grow back darker and thicker, which i understand isn�t true, but i was thinking it might be true for peach fuzz. Shaving only removes the hair that has grown. I have a lot of moderately long.</p>

<p>No one looks good with a beard looking like a cluster of small islands. Shaving a beard does not cause it to grow back thicker or faster. When you shave it off, the new beard heads appear to be taking more surface of your face, but once it grows it will again be the same. 2018 is the year for.</p>

<p>No one looks good with a beard looking like a cluster of small islands. When you shave and start growing a beard it again, it will appear to be thicker at the beginning (small optical illusion). 2018 is the year for a change. And to this day, i still don�t.

<p>Beard hairs grow at different rates, trim them all to the same length. I have a lot of moderately long peach fuzz on my cheeks and a dark hair here or there, but i�m not growing an actual beard. A common misconception is if you trim your beard, it will look thinner. Shaving removes your beard, leaving your beard alone.</p>

<p>By the details of your question, not factoring in that you are only 15, you may be one of those that can grow a beard but have a lighter growth on your mustache. There is no truth in this theory. This may create the illusion that hair has become darker or thicker. It may seem like that at first, as.</p>
