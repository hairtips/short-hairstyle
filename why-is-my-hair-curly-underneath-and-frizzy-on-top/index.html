The top layer is most exposed to the sun and elements so it usually tends to be more damaged, i would suggest treating that hair differently to the hair underneath. For example, you can use curling cream or gel that has a little more hold just on the top layers. The main cause.</p>

<p>Or you can opt for a more permanent solution. I think its about the drying time and also the humidity of my head.

<p>In this section, we will explain some of the most common causes of uneven hair textures. These deposits can build up on the hair causing the hair to look dull, limp and lifeless. This can cause the hair to curl underneath. Or you can opt for a more permanent solution. Ive tried putting recoil on those parts to curl them.</p>

For example, you can use curling cream or gel that has a little more hold just on the top layers. I think the moisture of my wet hair, paired with the fact that it is so close to.</p>

<p>Or you can opt for a more permanent solution. There are several reasons for your hair to be straight at the top and curly at the bottom, the first reason is you may have mixed hair type, naturally you may have the combination of straigh and curly hair textures, these textures are due to genetics, the next reason is, top.</p>
