<h3 id="due-to-its-greatness-and-sanctity-the-qur039an-should-be-regarded-with-the-utmost-respect">Due to its greatness and sanctity, the qur�an should be regarded with the utmost respect.</h3><p>The story of halima sa. For those with straight hair, you may be able to get away with washing your hair every day but be sure to use a conditioner every four or five days. He did not say that there was any reward for growing the hair long, nor is there any sin in shaving it, but he commanded men to take care of their hair. The prophet (blessings and peace of allah be upon him) both let his hair grow long and shaved it, and there is no reward in letting it grow long and no sin in shaving it. Our actions are only by our intention.
