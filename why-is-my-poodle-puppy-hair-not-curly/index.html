<p>This is because poodles have hair as opposed to fur, which means it consistently grows instead of falling out like fur. This may help it to form a tighter curl on its own. Most of the time, this coat is soft and thin compared to the thick one it develops in an adult. The hair around the face is usually.</p>

<p>A maltese does not have curly hair, but the coat is long and becomes wavy as it gets longer. Improper coats are not curly throughout and will often exhibit soft waves in patches or across the entire dog. That said, a maltese should have a fine undercoat with a silky topcoat. After a poodle has been groomed to give this.</p>

<p>The coat is to be straight and not curly. However, some poodle crosses may lack this quality and have straight hair.

<p>An f1 american cocker spaniel x miniature poodle has a high chance of having a tight curly coat as their curly gene is dominant.

<p>In fact, itâs impossible to brush thoroughly down. The nonappearance of cu locus implies that you will have a straight hair labradoodle.
