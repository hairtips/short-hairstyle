<p>The symbolism of shaving your head goes deep. If your hair is wavy or slightly curly, this should still work fine. Thinner hair means less sebum, which reduces your hair and scalp’s natural defenses. When your scalp’s oil production decreases, cool down the temperature. However, it’s perfectly normal in case you do it.</p>

<p>“if the hair has been damaged by chemical treatments or if the hair is naturally fine or weak, brushing when wet may stretch the hair and break it,” he adds. Should guys wet their hair every day? For most men, you can go two to three days on average before having to wash your hair. However, your hair does not.</p>

<p>The temperature of the water is very important. Furthermore, it combats frizzy strands. People with very dry hair do not need to wash their hair daily, or even every other day. “you should blow dry any hair that’s over two inches long, especially if you’re trying to wear it up and back off your forehead,” says bennett. One should use.</p>

<p>So, if there are people among the readers that enjoy salty styling sprays and are used to waking up and wetting their hair for the proper shape, this habit is lovely. Clay (sometimes referred to as mud) works like pomade, except that it�s stickier. The general recommendation is a few times per week, but you can use it daily. The.</p>

<p>Water saturation is damaging to hair, and brushing hair while saturated with water is even worse. “you should blow dry any hair that’s over two inches long, especially if you’re trying to wear it up and back off your forehead,” says bennett. It contains nutrients that nourish both the hair and scalp. This routine is standard for maintaining clean hair.</p>

<p>Only when people started working in offices and going out( especially women) they felt it was not fashionable to keep unstyled wet hair open. “you should blow dry any hair that’s over two inches long, especially if you’re trying to wear it up and back off your forehead,” says bennett. If your hair is thick and especially dry or damaged.</p>

<p>If you’re simply applying a small amount each day, then a solid rinse will take care of it. Men with thick hair, including those with very curly hair, have more sebum, which means they only need to wash every three days or roughly twice per week. Pay attention to the airflow and point the dryer in. However, your hair does.</p>

<p>Getting the hair wet on a daily basis, using only some freshwater, is perfectly ok for the scalp and hair. Clay (sometimes referred to as mud) works like pomade, except that it�s stickier. Water saturation is damaging to hair, and brushing hair while saturated with water is even worse. Men with thick hair, including those with very curly hair, have.</p>
