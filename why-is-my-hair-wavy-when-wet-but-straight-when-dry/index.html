Why does wavy hair dry straight? Dry hair can definitely get more wavy, but if you haven�t changed or skipped your usual conditioning/moisturizing my guess would be it�s just changing on.</p>

<p>When your hair is dry, it�ll look sleek and shiny. Brushing wavy hair when it’s wet will damage your curl structure, and some people will find their wavy hair will be frizzy and lifeless when it dries.

<p>There are five main reasons why i believe cutting curly hair when it is dry is better than cutting it wet. Curl shapes range from tight coils to ringlets but also irregular curl patterns. I follow some of the cgm as i have fine, medium thick, 2a/2b waves with some color damage as well. The external nourishment can be in.</p>

<p>This could have a lot to do with your washing and styling techniques. Apply texturising lotion to the rest of your hair. I don’t even know where my hair dryer is; Coily hair includes everything from miniature curls and tiny ringlets, to a full head of glorious tight curls that can be a nightmare to detangle. Shrinkage is what you.</p>

<p>The general consensus is that brushing hair when it’s wet can cause breakage since hair is weaker when it’s wet. Why does wavy hair dry straight? Your hair gets very thick and puffy when you cut it short. I have not blown my hair dry in, no lie, years. Just wash with shampoo, rinse, then use conditioner, rinse, and then.</p>

<p>Keep ends uneven which will help to keep your hair looking full of volume and bounce. Curl shapes range from tight coils to ringlets but also irregular curl patterns. Hairdressers opt for a wet haircut to avoid having to work around the natural movement of your hair when it�s dry, which can make achieving blunt, smooth cuts a little more.</p>

<p>Curl junkie curl assurance shampoo is also a good one. High temperatures can really do a number on hair that�s already rough and dry; This is the reason curly hair is very dry especially after a wash and the very reason we need to rely on external emollients to quench the thirst. I did this, and i saw more waves.</p>
