<p>But hormonal shifts—like those that occur during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause—can alter the shape of the hair follicle. I have been fighting with my hair most of my life. An increase in androgens in females can actually change the shape of the hair follicle from round to flat and this can instigate a change in texture from straight to curly. Some medications used to treat cancer, called epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, can also affect hair texture.</p>

Why has my curly hair gone straight? If you notice your hair is going from straight to curly, your hair follicles are changing. Your hair texture changes during menopause.
