<p>I think it�s only guaranteed to work on the back of the scalp but significant percentage of guys with receding hairlines find that it works for them too. That doesn�t mean it doesn�t work for the hairline. The drug is approved by the fda for this purpose, but not for treating the frontal hair loss that results in a receding.</p>

<p>Minox might get you short term results, but without fin you’re highly likely to worsen overtime. What is true is that rogaine minoxidil has primarily been tested only on the crown of the head in men, and so rogaine does not recommend it for use on the front of the scalp. Numerous treatments are available, and one of them is.</p>

<p>Minoxidil is a common hair loss treatment. Minoxidil may not fully help your hairline and has a lot of side effects. It won’t rescue a receding hairline. This means that minoxidil cannot restore a receded hairline. I want to ask for some advice on that (hoping the mods will reply to me about now being about to start a new.</p>

<p>Minox might get you short term results, but without fin you’re highly likely to worsen overtime. Basically any recent hair loss that is attributable to dht can theoretically be reversed. This means that minoxidil cannot restore a receded hairline. They said the same thing about propecia but i took it for four years and it worked like a charm for.</p>

<p>According to the manufacturer of rogaine, it does not work on receding hairline. So, choose the better options instead: The positive effects of minoxidil then starts to slowly decline ( 1 5). But mostly, it is associated with the combination of aging and hereditary. Minoxidil can destroy a hair line and make things worse.</p>

<p>However, a study on rogaine conducted in 2003 and published in the dermatology times. It was only officially tested on the back of the head. Rogaine is an fda approved topical hair loss treatment, also known as minoxidil.

<p>But why doesn’t it work on receding hairline? It was only officially tested on the back of the head. Im only using propecia at the moment. However, a study on rogaine conducted in 2003 and published in the dermatology times. Yes, but one of the rogaine side effects is mild skin irritations.</p>

<p>It was only officially tested on the back of the head. Minoxidil was originally developed to treat high blood pressure. As such, there’s no reason minoxidil shouldn’t work for a receding hairline. It works by increasing blood flow to the scalp and can cause the hair follicles to be revitalized. As such, there’s no reason minoxidil shouldn’t work for a.</p>

<p>That doesn�t mean it doesn�t work for the hairline. It is not recommended for women whose hair loss occurs suddenly or who experience patchy or uneven hair loss. Is minoxidil effective for a receding hairline? Im only using propecia at the moment. I want to ask for some advice on that (hoping the mods will reply to me about now.</p>
