<h3 id="half-pin-curl-puff-with-braids">Half pin curl puff with braids:</h3><p>Try to let your hair dry with natural air instead of using a blow dryer. Styling gels, pastes, waxes and pomades are all valid hair smoothing techniques to consider and which one of them will work best for you depends on your hair alone. You want a product like gel or mousse to help hold your waves together.
