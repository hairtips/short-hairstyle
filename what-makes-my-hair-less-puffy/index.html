<p>A little oil goes a long way, so adding too much can make your hair greasy. Make a puff at the back, and braid the rest of the hair in a cute french braid. Last i was wondering on how to get my hair to have beach waves or loose ringlets. Not mane and tail shampoo either.</p>
<h3 id="half-pin-curl-puff-with-braids">Half pin curl puff with braids:</h3><p>Try to let your hair dry with natural air instead of using a blow dryer. Styling gels, pastes, waxes and pomades are all valid hair smoothing techniques to consider and which one of them will work best for you depends on your hair alone. You want a product like gel or mousse to help hold your waves together. When you get out of the shower before bed, just put in some spray leave in conditioner in your hair, then put less than a dime size amount of hair serum on top of it, brush your hair so it looks smooth and wrap it in a silk scarf. If not then it will turn out complete bed head when u wake up. This is the reason why most of the women with puffy hair always get less hairstyle options.</p>
