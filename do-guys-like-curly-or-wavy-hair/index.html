<p>While it may seem like kind of a cliché that men can�t get enough of a woman with long, flowing locks, it turns out there�s actually a lot of truth to this.

<p>Thought my hair looked really pretty here and had a near perfect shape. This goes hand in hand with the number 4 reason why men prefer naturally curly hair.
