Broken Bones From yellowdogracing.com</p>
<p>A bone coming out may irritate the tongue, but luckily the condition is treatable. On the back of my head, ( behind my ears) on either side of the arch and indentation that connects with my neck, i have a bony protuberance. The important causes of this bone coming forward are any swelling inside the bone, deformity of spine or deformity of hip joint. You can easily feel it at the base of your neck, especially when you bend your head forward.</p>
<h3 id="every-since-my-daughter-was-born-i-noticed-that-she-has-prominent-occipital-bone-on-the-back-of-her-head">Every since my daughter was born i noticed that she has prominent occipital bone on the back of her head.</h3><p>You can easily feel it at the base of your neck, especially when you bend your head forward. The forward slumping also shortens the muscles in front of your torso and overstretches some back muscles. It is most likely a prominent zygomatic arch. Every since my daughter was born i noticed that she has prominent occipital bone on the back of her head. There are certain conditions (namely osteoporosis/compression fractures and cushing’s syndrome) that can also cause a bump at the base of the neck. The mayo clinic says that these factors can be chemical activity in your brain, the nerves of blood vessels surrounding your skull, or the muscles at the back of the head and neck.</p>
