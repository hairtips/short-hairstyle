<h3 id="when-hair-is-pulled-from-the-same-place-it-not-only-damages-the-hair-follicle-causing-stunted-or-abnormal-regrowth-but-also-the-skin">When hair is pulled from the same place, it not only damages the hair follicle (causing stunted or abnormal regrowth) but also the skin.</h3><p>Does pulling hair cause hair loss?

Twisting hair roughly worsens the situation because they can snap and pull out. If enough hair is pulled out, these damaged hair follicles can affect hair regrowth.
