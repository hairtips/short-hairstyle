<p>Choosing a new hairstyle and knowing how it will look without the risk of cutting your hair has never been easier! You need cuts and styles that help you give the illusion of cutting down the roundness and making your face look a little longer instead. But if you aren�t sure which one is for you, this quiz will definitely help you out! A strict center part will pull the focus down to the center of your face, which may not be the best bet for women looking to draw attention away from their nose.</p>
<h3 id="its-one-of-the-main-factors-you-need-to-take-into-consideration-when-youre-choosing-a-style-because-not-all-haircuts-are-flattering-on-every-face-type">It’s one of the main factors you need to take into consideration when you’re choosing a style because not all haircuts are flattering on every face type.</h3><p>The haircuts and styles that look good on a round chubby face are sleek straight hair with a side parting, side fringes with feathered waves, and a bob cut with a side fringe. Similarly if you have thinness at the crown area, avoid middle parting at all costs. If you haven’t already, consider identifying your face shape. You need to be able to correctly determine your face shape to know the haircuts and hairstyles that would give you the look you’re hoping to achieve. To find out if a short haircut looks good with your face, simply measure the distance between the earlobe and chin. “pinterest can help the client look at face shapes and find cuts that are best,” says tricomi.</p>
