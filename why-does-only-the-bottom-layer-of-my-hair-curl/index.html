<p>• the longer your top layer of hair grows, the heavier it becomes, causing it to look straighter. If you’ve had it with your straight hair at the top, you can perm that section to add curls to match the bottom layer of your hair. Likewise, cut hair shorter in front if it is straighter than the hair in the back. I had very curly wurly hair when i was at a very young age but then it waves out as it grew and as i was straightening and styling it to death as a teenager.</p>
<h3 id="curly-hair-is-thought-to-be-better-at-keeping-mammals-warmer-than-just-straight-hair-alone">Curly hair is thought to be better at keeping mammals warmer than just straight hair alone.</h3><p>It�s always been much drier than the underlayers, no matter what, if i recall correctly. What i mean by curly on bottom and straight on top is underneath my hair by my ears and nape of my neck my hair is very curly, but from the middle of my head up to the top, all the hair is straight. For example, the oval face, you can cut the bob hairstyle and combine a little bending curl lightly on the tail to create a highlight for the face. The print bed is not the only cold substance that molten filament contact. Remember, room air has a lower temperature than the molten filament. Identifying which one is affecting your hair may require some trial.</p>
