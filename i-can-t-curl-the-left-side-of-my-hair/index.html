My hair is 2b/2c i belive, i have curls and waves. And recently (in the last year) i’ve developed a bald spot right in the middle of my forehead where my hair line starts!!! I think it�s a personal preference as well. I always had poker straight hair until i had my son age 21, just a few waves at the back of my head, now after another 2 children and now at the age of 40 they’re more pronounced curls and slowly making their way around, currently just to the back of my ears on both sides, i can usually blow dry it straight but left wet, it’s very curly! I feel like i’ve tried everything from different shampoos and conditioners to brushing my hair wet but no matter what my hair is always knotty (this is after i brushed all the knots out wet)</p>

<p>When curling the right side, hold the flat iron in your right hand vertically from the top with the wand facing down. The back of my hair grows the fastest though! You’ll have to make sure no curls switch to the other side: Why can’t i get nice curls?? I think it�s a personal preference as well.</p>

<p>Put half of your curls on your right and the other half of the left side of your neck and then comb them in this position; Keeping the volume of my hair at the crown is my current curl problem, i try to use hair gels to keep my curls piecey, but it just makes them greasy and hard. organic.</p>

<p>I part mine on the right ( about 1/2in from the center) because my curls on my front left side are more relaxed (i think due to heat damage) than the ones on the right and this brings some of the curls from the right to the left so my hair looks more uniform. Spray some on your hair after.</p>

<p>The back of my hair grows the fastest though! Why can’t i get nice curls?? The side of my head is always frizzy and full of knots how can i fix this? It is not genetically predisposed to do so. Alternating the direction of your curls is totally fine, but don’t pick that pattern for one side of your face.</p>

<p>When the hair regains its moisture and strength, you may stretch your treatments to every two weeks. That was another technique i used to even things out and also one that i found could exacerbate the problem because if i parted more to the right then the right side that was already mega curly would get even curlier and make.</p>

<p>The curls on the side of my hair where i didn�t use the mousse had completely fallen out, and i had just a tiny slight wave in the middle and at. There can be too much of a good thing. Divide from the back, using your fingers to separate the sections. It’s thin, fine and straight as an ironing board..</p>

<p>You’re inclined to paint with your good hand first.) however, roy. My hair is 2b/2c i belive, i have curls and waves. Continue until your entire bottom section is finished. And recently (in the last year) i’ve developed a bald spot right in the middle of my forehead where my hair line starts!!! Then grab each section and twist it.</p>

<p>Hair on the right side of my hair grows slower than the hair on the left side of my hair.….as crazy as that sounds, it was reversed when i relaxed my hair. Oh and i’ve checked my ends and they are fine.… i don’t understand it and i wish that it would catch up already!!!! I�m pretty sure she did.</p>

<p>They’re also the easiest to style. Especially if you massage your scalp with some warmed up jamaican black. Lay one in front of each shoulder, then pick up a flat clip and secure the right one so the hair is pulled away from the left section. And skip conditioner — which weighs down hair, making it harder to stay curly.</p>
