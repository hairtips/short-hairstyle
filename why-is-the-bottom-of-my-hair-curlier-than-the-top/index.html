<p>It�s a poll i made about the difference in curliness between underlayer and canopy. When i hit my 30’s, i noticed that my hair was becoming slightly lighter and my waves were obvious even when my hair was long.

<p>When your hair is cut wet, it’s shorter than you wanted once it dries. You see, when external layers are cut, all the weight of your hair is removed from the outside of your hair. Having hair that looks straight but is poofy is one sign of having wavy hair or curly hair. I don’t know what to do with.</p>

<p>The hair on the top half of your head is also usually naturally lighter than the rest of your hair. Your hair may only curl at the bottom if you need layers.
