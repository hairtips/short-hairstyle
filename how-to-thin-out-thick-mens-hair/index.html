<p>If the hair is especially thick, ask your barber or stylist to take some of the weight out using special thinning scissors.

<p>Now you can thin your hair easily without spending some money in a salon or barbershop. I suggest the kevin murphy killer curls ($33) Layers are probably the most popular way to do this because having the hair at different lengths breaks up some of the volume and makes the hair lighter and thinner overall.
