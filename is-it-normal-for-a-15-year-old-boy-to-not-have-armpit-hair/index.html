<p>The reason for it is most likely genetics — if you or your child�s other parent had a lot of body hair as a toddler (or someone in either of your families did), your toddler simply inherited the body hair. The physical changes of puberty for a boy usually start with enlargement of the testicles and sprouting of pubic hair, followed by a growth spurt between ages 10 and 16 — on average 1 to 2 years later than when girls start. As kids mature physically and emotionally, they become increasingly curious about their sexuality and their own bodies. This part of puberty is called adrenarche.</p>

The thing is that you don’t have to worry about this too much because in time you will have armpit hair and you would wish it isn’t there, believe me. A few pubic hairs become visible and they are long, straight, and slightly dark. Pubic hair has filled in and spread to the inner thighs. They also may gain muscle rapidly at this age. A girl usually gets their first period between 10 and 16 years old (about 2 to 2 1/2 years after they start puberty.) menstruation is a sign that they�re physically an adult and able to get pregnant.</p>
