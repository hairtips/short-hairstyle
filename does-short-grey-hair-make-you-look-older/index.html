As you can see above, gray hair does not automatically make one look.</p>

<p>I was poised to begin my new career as an older model. Does short hair make u look older or younger? Don’t let your hair age you. As you get older, your hair loses not only pigment but also its ability to retain moisture. It’s very dark on top, and that makes the face look bolder and younger.</p>
