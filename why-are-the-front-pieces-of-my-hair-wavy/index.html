<p>This blog is where i share what i’ve learned, in hopes of helping others. I suggest doing the same, but in the morning before school, with water and gel. My hair is long past my shoulder blades. Why choose wet and wavy hair. As they age, the curls will become more curly and noticeable.</p>

<p>It might be from the water hitting the back of my head harder in the shower or because of the weight of my hair. I battle tangles like you wouldn’t believe. But what about when the hair framing your face continues to snap and break before it ever has the chance to grow into a luscious fringe or pretty tendrils?.</p>

<p>If you have strong hair, and my hair is straight on top and curly on bottom you can choose to cut the pixie hairstyle in order to increase the size and increase the thickness of the hair. But what about when the hair framing your face continues to snap and break before it ever has the chance to grow into.</p>

<p>The same thing could happen with people who have thick hairs but curl producing hair follicles, especially women who have had long hair their whole lives. That lack of moisture leads to more frizz. For 360 waves you need to brush your top forward. Sometimes, it actually happens that, one person’s head can have different curl patterns, or the lack.</p>

<p>I am a redhead and now have a mixed curl pattern (2b/2c/3a) so ringlets, s waves and mild waves all mixed together. This happens more than you would think.
