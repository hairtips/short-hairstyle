When is it Normal to Start Puberty? From pediatrixmd.com</p>
<p>Is this normal or do i have some sort of glandular or hormone problem? Armpit hair, also referred to as axillary hair, gets its start from puberty. I�m 15, 16 in a few months. Though pubic hair growth is more earlier sign but it may vary.</p>
<h3 id="don039t-worry-you-soon-will-get-arm-pit-hair-some-boys-have-arm-pit-hair-sooner-than-pubic-hair-the-reverse-applies-to-other-boys-thinking-back-i-think-i-got-both-about-the-same-age-13-just-small-hairs-then-but-by-20-they-both-were-about-3-longand-growing">Don�t worry, you soon will get arm pit hair, some boys have arm pit hair sooner than pubic hair, the reverse applies to other boys, thinking back, i think i got both about the same age, 13, just small hairs then, but by 20 they both were about 3 long.and growing.</h3><p>Several things change usually in the early to mid teens but there is a wide spectrum of ages this happens. I was worried too so i googled. They will also have acne, their voice will change or “crack” and get deeper, and they start to sweat more. The penis also grows in length, then in width. Is this normal or do i have some sort of glandular or hormone problem? The reason why this increase occurs earlier in some children is not known.</p>
