I actually prefer light skin, not suntanned skin, but very dark hair (almost pitch black) and blue/green eyes. Why are blondes considered beautiful. Reason why blondes may be seen that way is because over 95% (personal estimate) of the world�s population is not blonde. We guess that when a guy has previously been burned by going blonde, they turn to someone who will be less likely to hurt his feels. It depends on the face and there�s lots of blonde women with unattractive faces.</p>

Why are blondes considered beautiful. Well, she has her qualities. I have certainly seen some blondes who looked very attractive, but then again i�ve seen some very gorgeous.</p>

<p>What doesn’t surprise me is that filipinas are beautiful, no matter if they have dark skin or light skin. So, no, blondes aren�t certainly the most attractive women. It has been misunderstood over the centuries, and of course not considered beautiful. It depends on the face and there�s lots of blonde women with unattractive faces. For a scandinavian, i have.</p>

<p>It�s got nothing to do with hair colour. This social stereotype is further perpetuated by the mass media. Why are blondes considered beautiful. Blondes are much more photogenic than the rest, so it is easier for them to make men fall in love, especially on the internet. For a scandinavian, i have very dark hair, but with a blonde tint.</p>

<p>So, no, blondes aren�t certainly the most attractive women. Similarly it is another social stereotype that the must beautiful women are blond haired blue eye�d or women have to be blond haired blue eyed to be considered beautiful.
