<p>The torah does not say anything about required hair length for males or females except that when a man takes a nazirite vow he must not cut his hair at all (he should let his hair grow). Some read his letter and think hair length is his main point. A woman’s hair must cover her ears and neck to be.</p>

<p>In this passage paul teaches plainly the following principles: Women’s and men’s hair are to be distinct in length.

We are to worship god in spirit and in truth, obey the law and offer justice in a.</p>

<p>Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him? Any length is appropriate if the hair is long enough to be a covering and feminine. But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her; In this passage paul teaches plainly the following principles: A woman’s.</p>

<p>And similarly it is no longer a shame for women to have short hair, as long as they don’t look like men. Again this is hardly ever the case. This includes hair and grooming. How can we say that? But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of god.</p>

<p>Women’s and men’s hair are to be distinct in length. 1 corinthians 11:14 doesn�t nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, 1 corinthians 11:16 if anyone is inclined to dispute this, we have no other practice, nor do the churches of god. He is not saying a woman should wear.</p>
