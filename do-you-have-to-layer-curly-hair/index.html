<p>Whether or not a person with curly hair will look good with a layered haircut depends largely on how curly the hair is, the texture of the hair, and the hair’s density, and the kind of layering that is done.

<p>Those of you with curly hair may prefer more layering than those with straight hair no matter what you determined for the previous factors. Curly hair is so much fun to play up and can be morphed into just about any hairstyle. Reasons to add layers to your curly hair are numerous including the fact that layers make hair lively.</p>

<p>Curls tend to respond well and behave better when there is not a blunt weight line as layers allow them more movement and bounce which helps them lay better. If hair volume and body is what you want from your curly hair then adding uniform layers (pictured left) throughout your hair will balance out the body and volume, while layers.</p>

<p>Touching curly hair during the drying process can disrupt the curl pattern and lead to frizz and flyaways. This is super important because any knots left in your hair can make your layers turn out uneven. Layers work on curly hair of all lengths and levels of thickness, regardless of if you have a textured pixie or long, wavy princess.</p>

<p>Layers work on curly hair of all lengths and levels of thickness, regardless of if you have a textured pixie or long, wavy princess locks.
