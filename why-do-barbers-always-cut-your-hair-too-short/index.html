</center> <p><strong>Why Do Barbers Always Cut Your Hair Too Short</strong>, Because if your hair is wavy then that would cause it to become poofy. This is because barbers are usually using very sharp clippers and if there are not clipper guards in place, the barber is likely to cut your hair badly and the result would be a messy haircut.</p>

<p>The answer is no, a barber can not cut your hair too short because it is his job to cut your hair. My guess is because you might decide to add a service that you didn’t originally ask for; Your hair is super damaged. For example, if you were used to styling a slick back before, there’s a very good chance it’s now too short to do so.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do-if-your-barber-gives-you-a-bald-spot">What to do if your barber gives you a bald spot.</h3><p>This next reason is a hard pill for all of us to swallow: A barber’s haircut quality depends not on the length of the hair but the quality of the hair cutting equipment. It may be hard for the first few days but likely in a week or so. The length will look a lot cuter if you have your natural waves/curls! Short and long are all relative from barber to the barber. For example, if you were used to styling a slick back before, there’s a very good chance it’s now too short to do so.</p>
