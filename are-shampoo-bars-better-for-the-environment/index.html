<p>Shampoo bars were used prior to the commercialization of liquid shampoo in the 1930s. Shampoo bars and conditioner bars are great for saving space. We suggest that you use a solid shampoo bar instead of your usual shampoo. The shampoo bar is a superb invention to discover!</p>

<p>The plastic waste that usually accompanies hair care products like shampoo is no.

<p>Sea salt shampoo and solid shampoo bars. One company, lush, has been making shampoo bars since the 1990s.

Another plus is that they supposedly last longer, too.</p>

<p>Solid shampoo and conditioner bars are usually packaged in biodegradable paper boxes instead of plastic bottles.

<p>It is much better for the environment, and it has several more benefits that will really surprise you.

One of the major and most obvious.</p>
