</center> <p><strong>Why Is My Hair Sometimes Wavy And Sometimes Straight</strong>, When straight hair becomes curly this suggests that something is happening to the shape of the hair follicles but no one knows why that happens or what causes it, although hormones are considered to play a role even though there is presently no evidence to confirm this. Most hair does not change drastically, although it has been known to happen.</p>

<p>Most hair does not change drastically, although it has been known to happen. So my mom cut my hair very short. Or you might have a little bit of round follicle dna and a little bit of oval follicle dna. Get better results on day 2 dirty hair ( after correct prepping for curling your hair ).</p>
<h3 id="now-im-51-going-through-menopause-and-still-having-surgeries-and-my-hair-has-decided-to-be-wavy-and-kinda-frizzy">Now i’m 51, going through menopause and still having surgeries and my hair has decided to be wavy and kinda frizzy.</h3><p>But on any given day my hair can be super curly or straight with a really weird curl. It can remain dormant until activated and then it changes the shape of the hair follicle which changes the hair that grows from it. Just wash with shampoo, rinse, then use conditioner, rinse, and then “squish” your hair up to your scalp to see if waves form. I wear my hair in a man bun all the time. I began to examine closer and noticed that some hair strands are bent and some even have like 5 bends to them! Some may say that wavy hair can take on a mind of its own.</p>

<p>Wavy hair is said to dry in an “s” pattern. I’ve had surgery off and on my whole life. So my mom cut my hair very short.

<p>So my mom cut my hair very short. You would have wavy hair. After that,my hair was poker straight. Knowing what products work for your hair is key. Your hair gets very thick and puffy when you cut it short.</p>

<p>Dry shampoo should become your staple product. I wear my hair in a man bun all the time. Because wavy hair is usually weak and soft, it is vulnerable to hardening, combing or chemical processing. Type 2 hair is defined by large loose �s� style waves, typically the hair strands fall closely to the head. With waves being fragile, just.</p>

<p>In this case you would have straight hair. If you are just trying this the first time, you do not have to do that. It starts with your genetics.

<p>I did this, and i saw more waves and more defined waves in my hair than before, but the difference was fairly subtle.

<p>If you’re in the habit of brushing or combing your hair, this may be causing it to dry straight. Method 2 and 3 both give me straight hair at the back at most 2a, method 1 usually gives me about 80% straight hair and then if any water touches it then it.

<p>Wavy hair is said to dry in an “s” pattern. Curly/wavy hair follicles are more oval so not as much oil comes out.
