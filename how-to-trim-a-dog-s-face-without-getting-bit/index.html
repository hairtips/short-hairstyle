<p>While it’s likely that you’ll have to trim your dog’s nails fairly regularly, taking your dog on walks outdoors can help. Before we start, we need to stress that groom. Lift the dog’s chin up in the air and dampen the chin fur, then dampen the fur on the back of the dog’s head from the ears down. It is time to clip your dog�s fur and maybe trim his toenails, and he�s sitting perfectly still, happy to let you flip him and flop him however you need in order to get the job done.</p>
<h3 id="thank-you-so-much-for-your-support-and-subscribing">Thank you so much for your support and subscribing!</h3><p>Start trimming the hair around the dog�s eyes. It may be wise to get ted used to the sound of the clippers by working on his back legs first, and once he realizes that is okay, move to the front legs and then the face. Lift the dog’s chin up in the air and dampen the chin fur, then dampen the fur on the back of the dog’s head from the ears down. If your dog’s nail starts bleeding that means you hit the quick. While you are trimming the fur around your dog�s eyes you can also do a quick eyelash check to make sure your dog does not have any eyelashes growing inward. This includes the fur on the neck and the top of the head if that is getting cut.</p>
