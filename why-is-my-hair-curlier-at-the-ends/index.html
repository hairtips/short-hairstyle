<p>That relatively smaller number of cells on the inside creates a shorter edge, which pulls the follicle inwards, creating the curl. In terms of hair, it often becomes thinner and finer.

<p>Keeping hair well moisturized, especially after washing can help prevent this. Firstly, it can be due to genetic reasons. In this way, hair may appear springier and curlier because that heaviness is suddenly gone. I also recommend brushing it at night (or when it�s wet) and just combing through with you fingers in the morning!! Wet hair will really stretch.</p>

<p>This reduced frizz, added strength and shine, and made my. Put the flat iron down. As your hair grows longer the weight starts to pull from the bottom up to your roots, resulting in your curl pattern being stretched and elongated. Over time, it lacks the amount of strength, moisture, and elasticity it needs to curl and stretch properly. Wavy.</p>

<p>The tiny balls at the end of your hair are called single strand knots or fairy knots. However, the hair underneath is curlier than the rest of your hair. Sometimes a new hair cut can bring a little bounce back into your hair by using scissors to create varying layers and textures in your hair. This is especially common in.</p>

<p>However, the hair underneath is curlier than the rest of your hair. I usually put it in pigtails and twirl them and let it air dry.

<p>The ends of your hair flip in or out instead of staying straight. This happens more than you would think. You see, when external layers are cut, all the weight of your hair is removed from the outside of your hair. Or maybe your hair might be damaged. Wavy hair needs some length in order for the waves to show.</p>

<p>You may think that hair does not weight much, which is true, but imagine that constant weight everyday, year round. This happens more than you would think. I usually put it in pigtails and twirl them and let it air dry. Put the flat iron down. Your hair may only be wavy at the ends if it’s weighed down.</p>

<p>This is also why you don’t see your wavy hair when you have shorter hair. That would clarify why your hair curls up only when it gets longer. This can cause the hair to curl underneath. Over time, it lacks the amount of strength, moisture, and elasticity it needs to curl and stretch properly. Wet hair will really stretch your.</p>
