<p>Videos you watch may be added to the tv�s watch history and influence tv recommendations. A lot of people who have permed/coloured hair have very brittle hair, that retains far less water, but that means it dries very quickly. Everybody�s hair appears longer when wet just because of the weight of the water on the hair. I did trim my hair in august of 2012 i think it was august 8th to be exact.</p>
<h3 id="your-hair-needs-more-conditioner-nader-said">“your hair needs more conditioner,” nader said.</h3><p>The longer we shed excessively, the fewer and fewer long hairs are still present, so. When your hair is healthy it is actually quite porous, and so will retain water for a lot longer than if it were heat/chemical damaged. Common causes of oily hair are unhealthy eating habits, medications, improper hair care, stress, hormonal fluctuations, and change in weather. And depending on your hair type throughout the day maybe it�s humid &amp; your scalp starts to sweat causing hair to wave/coil which could make it seem shorter :) You might think that you�re doing your scalp a favor by scrubbing it regularly, but overwashing your hair. Long hair = high maintenance.</p>

<p>If you love the long look, go for it! Lighting and appearance of hair loss, aging, and cellulite. How my hair looked when wet was another sign that it was naturally wavy, not straight. They looked brittle and unkempt. Northern hemisphere dwellers, or most of the earth�s population, have probably all noticed longer days and shorter nights in the summer.</p>

<p>I hadn�t cut my hair for about two years, and i missed having short hair. Long hair = high maintenance.
