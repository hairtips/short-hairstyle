I used to constantly wish I had &quot;normal&quot; straight hair From reddit.com</p>
<p>All the curly hairs want straight, and all the straight hairs want curly. 4. Type 2 is wavy hair. According to the show�s professional love guru, patti stanger, men just aren�t that into curly hair. He likes the way it looks:</p>
<h3 id="i-prefer-curly-hair-attractive-in-blacks-wavy-hair-attractive-in-gingersitalians-and-straight-hair-attractive-in-whites">I prefer curly hair attractive in blacks, wavy hair attractive in gingers/italians, and straight hair attractive in whites.</h3><p>Here�s a quote, but i�ve forgotten the source: I think the wavy hair ala evangeline lilly (lost) is quite beautiful. Wavy hair normally has plenty of body and naturally holds volume, hence every man’s hairstyle works for this texture. Yes, she looks good with straight hair but there’s a level of superficiality to that style that doesn’t exist in the photo of her with curly hair. So it may seem like someone had straight hair, then stopped brushing their hair, started plopping, diffusing and using gel and suddenly their hair “became” wavy or curly. You can change your hair anytime so go with what the mood strikes everyday.</p>
