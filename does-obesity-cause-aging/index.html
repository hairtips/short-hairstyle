12 Proven Ways To Control And Manage AgeRelated Obesity From positivehealthwellness.com</p>
<p>Our hypothesis was that increasing obesity would be independently associated with lower spo2 in an ambulatory elderly population. The cardiovascular health study ascertained resting spo2 in 2,252 subjects over age 64. Since proper cognition help the elderly live fuller and more independent lives, this effect of obesity is more relevant than ever with older age. While there are positive effects of obesity including increased energy reserve and prevention of malnutrition, protection from bone mineral density loss and osteoporosis, and delay in cognitive decline, there are also potential biases which may account for the obesity paradox seen in the elderly.</p>

The worldwide increase in the prevalence of obesity is likely responsible for the recent increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes because obesity influences both insulin action and β cell function. Obesity has also been clearly linked to a lesser quality of life. People who lead a sedentary lifestyle burn fewer calories than active individuals. Since proper cognition help the elderly live fuller and more independent. Obesity can also affect the severity of chronic conditions.</p>

<p>Obesity is a common, serious, and costly chronic disease. Among the elderly, many medical consequences particularly of obesity are problematic (e.g., t2dm, arthritis, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, urinary incontinence, and depression). Although these data are clear that obese older people are at greater risk of premature death, there is no evidence that the effect is parallel for overweight older people..</p>

<p>Obesity also affects cognition, which includes the way we process information, memory, comprehension, problem solving and decisions.
