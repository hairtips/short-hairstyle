<p>Although both men and women may experience hair loss, it is not as widespread in women as in men and appears differently. The hairline usually begins receding just above the temples. The first sign is a receding hairline, which can appear uneven at first, but then typically develops into a distinct m shape. With the horseshoe shape, the hairline recedes.</p>

The constant tugging and pulling can put extra stress of the hair follicles and cause hair loss in the front. If you naturally have a high hairline then wearing your hair in a ponytail is probably not a good idea. However, it can be an early.</p>

<p>If you naturally have a high hairline then wearing your hair in a ponytail is probably not a good idea. Or when someone age, this hair problem happens as a normal fact.
