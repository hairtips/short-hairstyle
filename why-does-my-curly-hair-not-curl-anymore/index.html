<p>Now my hair hardly has a curl pattern. Using normal shampoo and conditioner wrecks your curls. Again, my results were impressive! You are turning your curling iron heat up too high there can be too much of a good thing. When it comes to hair, our follicles determine the structure of our hair.</p>

<p>Curly hair consultant delilah orpi: Again, my results were impressive! Hormonal changes like pregnancy, puberty or menopause can cause your curl pattern to change drastically. I usually direct them to the curly girl method, a special method of caring for your curls that tends to revive them over time. Something i heard and learned over the years is this:</p>

<p>That was the moment i knew i had to make a change. Lightening your hair lifts the hair cuticles (in order for the bleach to reach the core of the hair shaft), but often they won�t lay flat again afterward. When you curl from the bottom to the top, the bottom of your hair is getting most of the heat..</p>

<p>His reply is what hit home for me; Why does my hair look curly when wet but dries straight? Too much heat breaks down the hair and dries the hair causing breakage and slower growth. I usually direct them to the curly girl method, a special method of caring for your curls that tends to revive them over time. Hormonal.</p>

<p>For me, the gray needed more moisture, lots more moisture. Curly hair is a bit more delicate than straight hair, and the tighter the curl or coil, the more fragile the strand. While i know many curlies who would love loose flowy curls, grass being mostly greener on the other side, there are many curlies who look for ways to.</p>

<p>Now my hair hardly has a curl pattern. A light milky leave in and gel will probably give better results. Hard water can cause build up on the hair which can affect the hair’s health overall. During my second wash day i replaced the aussie instant freeze gel with kinky curly curling custard. When it comes to hair, our follicles.</p>

<p>Dirty hair is the best hair to achieve desired results. When it comes to hair, our follicles determine the structure of our hair. Eventually, my hair began to lose its curl shape, it became lifeless and thinned out, but i was in denial.

<p>As i said before, your hair curling inwards can have multiple reasons, and cutting your hair just not right is only one of them. For me, the gray needed more moisture, lots more moisture.
